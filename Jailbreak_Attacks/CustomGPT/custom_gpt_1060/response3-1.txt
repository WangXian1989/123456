Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit (currently $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) / IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) / IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. Generally, 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses is recommended.

5. **Diversification**: Hold a variety of asset types across accounts to optimize your investment strategy.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess and adjust your contributions and investment choices as your financial situation and tax laws change.

7. **Work with a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This approach balances immediate benefits with long-term growth, while also considering tax efficiency.
