The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), and funds grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider keeping lower-dividend investments here to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments (stocks, mutual funds) that can benefit from compounding.
   - **Income Generation:** Consider using taxable accounts for income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) to manage tax impacts more effectively.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally, tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to optimize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your allocations based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Summary
A balanced approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, focusing on your employerâ€™s 401(k) match, and then managing investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax liabilities. Tailor your strategy to fit your unique situation, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
