The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay taxes on any dividends, interest, and capital gains realized within these accounts.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid and accessible account before investing excessively in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Horizon**: 
   - If you have a long investment horizon (10+ years), you may benefit from taking more risks (e.g., stocks) within tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping those funds in a taxable account for easier access and lower penalties for withdrawal.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes, industries, and geographical areas to manage risk.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on life changes, market conditions, or changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, speaking to a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your unique situation.

In summary, a balanced approach may involve maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (up to the employer match for a 401(k), full contributions to an IRA) while maintaining flexibility in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
