Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k), especially with matching contributions, consider maximizing this account first. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money. The contribution limits are higher here compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider funding an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility (no contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions), but keep in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

To optimize your investment strategy:
- Diversify your investments among these accounts, balancing risk based on your age and time until retirement.
- Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your unique situation and goals.
