When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account. Here’s a breakdown of the best approach to help you maximize your investments and tax advantages:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider whether it aligns with your tax strategy. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - After maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), direct additional savings to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - If you choose a traditional IRA, consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding between pre-tax (traditional) and after-tax (Roth) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or as a flexible investment option. These can include savings for a home or travel, or simply to keep some liquidity.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when placing investments in taxable accounts. Long-term investments (held for more than a year) are taxed at a lower rate, so consider index funds or ETFs that tend to have lower turnover.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed mutual funds that generate higher short-term capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk. This applies to all accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily contributing to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months’ worth of expenses set aside in a savings account.

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments as needed based on financial goals, market performance, and changes in your life circumstances.
