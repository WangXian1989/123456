When considering the best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to factor in your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA after meeting any employer match in your 401(k). A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions today.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on building your contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) then IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts. This helps grow your money tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional money into taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties and allows for investment in a broader range of assets.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth or tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. Conversely, holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can help maximize after-tax returns.

6. **Keep An Eye on Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust your contributions based on your current and expected future tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better choice for some of your savings.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and the performance of your investments in each account to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your specific circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, so it's crucial to tailor these strategies to meet your needs and goals.
