It's important to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation. However, I can outline some general strategies for distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributing to accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA, where your investments can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (if it's a Roth IRA).

2. **Employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of the match since it's essentially free money.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices in each account are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Consider your tax bracket**: Place investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal, while keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to align with your financial goals and retirement plans.
