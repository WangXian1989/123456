1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-ups**: Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function tests and imaging studies can help track the condition.
