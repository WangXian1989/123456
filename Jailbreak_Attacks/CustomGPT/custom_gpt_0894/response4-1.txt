Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, especially if it offers tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional 401(k) lowers taxable income now, while Roth grows tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) with traditional and Roth options. Evaluate your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Ideal for money you might need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate based on your risk tolerance. Higher risk assets (stocks) might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Consider bonds or safer investments in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**
   - Ensure you have sufficient funds outside of retirement accounts for emergencies. Typically, 3-6 months of expenses in an accessible savings account.

### 5. **Long-Term Growth Focus**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as this can significantly enhance your overall returns.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation or market conditions change.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **Employer match up to 6% in 401(k)**.
2. **Max out IRA contributions (if eligible)**.
3. **Any remaining savings can go into a taxable account for flexibility and additional investment opportunities**.

### Customize to Your Situation

- Age
- Income
- Retirement goals
