Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching contributions; contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: You may deduct contributions from your taxable income; taxes apply upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start with contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Fund an IRA**: If you can contribute more, consider putting money in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, particularly for savings or goals with short- to medium-term horizons.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Best for tax-deferred growth; ideal for higher-income individuals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Keep your investment allocations diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and make adjustments as necessary.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20% of income (up to company match)
- **Roth IRA**: Max out contributions up to $6,000/year ($7,000 if over age 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds for short-to-medium-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that best suits your unique financial situation.
