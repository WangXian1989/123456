To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may either pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Use these for money you might need before retirement and for holding investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends).

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with the longest time horizon (e.g., Roth IRA or taxable accounts).
   - For shorter-term needs, consider more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk appropriately. Adjust the ratios based on your overall risk tolerance.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits: For 2023, up to $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Some accounts may have higher fees associated with certain investments. Look for low-cost investment options, especially in your 401(k).

7. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation and goals.
