When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may reduce your taxable income, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not provide any immediate tax benefits, but they offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and no penalties for accessing your funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Generally, growth-oriented assets (like stocks) are better suited for long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more stable investments (like bonds) might be more appropriate for taxable accounts if you're concerned about short-term volatility.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible account.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors to mitigate risk.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

7. **Balanced Approach**: A possible approach might be to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then contribute to a Roth IRA if you are eligible, and finally invest any additional money in your taxable account.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances and goals.
