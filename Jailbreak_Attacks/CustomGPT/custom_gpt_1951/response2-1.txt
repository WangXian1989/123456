The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After receiving the full employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) if it offers good investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the criteria, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older), while for IRAs, it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA may be more advantageous. If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth account might be preferable.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalty, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on your investments.

6. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. This is crucial for achieving a balanced portfolio.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations, tax laws, and investment goals change over time. Regularly reassess your contributions and allocations to ensure they align with your current goals.

It can also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances and objectives.
