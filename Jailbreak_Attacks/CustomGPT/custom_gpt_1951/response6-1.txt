The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible. This provides tax advantages that can enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Compare the tax implications of each account. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - In contrast, taxable accounts do not offer immediate tax benefits, but any capital gains tax is typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Consider Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments, as you want these to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes, considering the order in which to tap accounts (for example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue to grow).

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
