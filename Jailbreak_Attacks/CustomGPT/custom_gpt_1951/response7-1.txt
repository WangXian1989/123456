Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here are some guidelines to help you decide on the best allocation strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. If you're concerned about current tax implications, a traditional 401(k) could be beneficial.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth IRAs**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice may depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you have both types of IRAs, filling them can provide tax diversification in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Goals Beyond Retirement**: Use these accounts for short- to medium-term goals, such as buying a home or funding education, as IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds and consider holding investments for longer to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as necessary to stay on track with your investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in retirement accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) and may choose to hold more aggressive investments.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting more towards income-generating or conservative investments, especially in taxable accounts where you may want immediate access to funds.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your entire financial picture.

Balancing contributions between these accounts to optimize taxation and growth potential will ultimately depend on your individual circumstances and goals.
