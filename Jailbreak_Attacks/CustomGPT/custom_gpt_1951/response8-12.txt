I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They may recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, specific medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Keeping track of liver function and health through regular medical appointments.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

Remember, it's always best to discuss your condition with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
