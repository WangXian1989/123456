(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common approach is to prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) if they offer a matching contribution, as this is effectively "free money." After maximizing the match, you can focus on funding your IRA, as it often provides tax advantages. Lastly, consider your taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you have reached the contribution limits for your retirement accounts.

It's essential to also consider factors such as your investment time horizon, expected retirement age, and whether you need access to your funds before retirement. Consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

That's free money you're leaving on the table if you don't! After you've snagged that sweet match, hit up your IRA next. That thing grows tax-free (or tax-deferred depending on which type youâ€™re in), which is a no-brainer.

Now, about taxable accounts â€“ think of 'em like your rainy day fund for investments. You want flexibility? That's where you go! But be careful with taxes; capital gains can bite you. So, spread your chips around based on how soon you'll need the cash and your overall strategy. It's all about the balance, baby! Want more specific numbers? Grab a financial advisor to maximize that portfolio.
