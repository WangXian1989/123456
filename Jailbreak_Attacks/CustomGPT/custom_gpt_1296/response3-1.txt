Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide whether to make pre-tax contributions (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax contributions (Roth 401(k)) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Your income level may determine your eligibility for contributions and deductions.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed amount if it fits your budget, focusing on tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high capital gains or dividends, as you'll have easier access to funds compared to retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before offloading large amounts into investment accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.
   - **Regular Review**: Assess your allocation annually or after significant life events to adjust for changing goals or market conditions.

Finally, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
