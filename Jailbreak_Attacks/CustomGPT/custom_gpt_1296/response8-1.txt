It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, but a general strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts includes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they often offer tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need to access sooner or if you want more investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes on capital gains in taxable accounts and the tax implications of withdrawals from retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Always assess your unique circumstances, as the best strategy can vary based on individual financial goals, age, and risk tolerance.
