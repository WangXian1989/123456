When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your preference for tax treatment. IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and accessibility. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: If you're investing in a taxable account, prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you’re aligned with your investment goals.

This distribution strategy can help you leverage tax advantages while ensuring you’re saving effectively for retirement. Be sure to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
