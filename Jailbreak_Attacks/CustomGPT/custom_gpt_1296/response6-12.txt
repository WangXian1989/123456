I'm not a medical professional, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare provider to discuss your liver problem and get personalized treatment options. They can fully assess your condition and recommend the best course of action. If you have specific symptoms or concerns, feel free to share those, and I can help guide you on general knowledge about liver health!
