The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Account**: Generally, it's wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Focus on maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After meeting your 401(k) contribution goals, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, as withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be preferable if you need the tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your retirement accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in accessing your funds, but they also come with tax implications on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

A well-balanced approach would involve prioritizing your 401(k) for employer contributions, maxing out your IRA contributions next, and using your taxable account for additional investing or liquidity needs.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
