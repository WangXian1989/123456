The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current tax situation, retirement goals, employer match opportunities, and investment options available in each account. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on your income.

3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, you can continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Keep in mind that 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’re maxing out both your 401(k) and IRA and still have additional funds to invest, consider putting money into a taxable brokerage account. This gives you more flexibility to access funds before retirement and may allow for easier tax management.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: Be mindful of your overall asset allocation across all accounts. Depending on the type of investments you hold in each account (stocks, bonds, etc.), you may want to adjust your allocations to optimize growth or minimize risk.

6. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of the accounts. For example, more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) might be better in taxable accounts, whereas higher yield investments could be better suited for tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changing income, expenses, and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
