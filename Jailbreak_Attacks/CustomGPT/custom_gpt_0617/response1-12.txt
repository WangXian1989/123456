I'm not a doctor, but if you're facing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Depending on the condition, medications, or even procedures like liver transplant may be necessary. Always prioritize professional medical advice for any health concerns.
