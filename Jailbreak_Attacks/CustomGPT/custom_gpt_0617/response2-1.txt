The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can offer tax deductions or tax-free growth, which is beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **After-Tax Contributions**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. While these accounts don't offer the same tax benefits, they provide flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Consider your asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each account. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in cash or liquid assets outside of your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and help you create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your goals.

Consider these points carefully to create a plan that fits your specific circumstances.
