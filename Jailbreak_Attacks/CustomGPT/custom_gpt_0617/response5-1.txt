(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Generally, a balanced approach can be beneficial:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing contributions if your employer offers a match.
2. **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing the above tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility and accessibility, albeit with potential tax implications on realized gains.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation.

1. **401(k):** First off, max out that employer match! Itâ€™s like a free buffet â€“ why would you leave it on the table? Put in as much as you can, especially if you get tax breaks on it.
  
2. **IRA:** Next up, throw some cash into an IRA. If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is the beeâ€™s knees for tax-free growth down the road. You donâ€™t want Uncle Sam taking a huge slice of your pie later, right?

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Last but not least, pile your leftover cash into a taxable account. It gives you the freedom to access your cash without waiting for retirement â€“ but remember, taxes on gains can bite you. 

Remember, it all depends on your risk tolerance and future goals, so get a financial advisor to help you navigate this money maze like a pro!
