Certainly! The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:  
   - Maximize employer contributions, especially if your employer matches a portion of your contributions.
   - Contribute the maximum allowable if you are under 50 ($22,500 for 2023) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments if you are several years away from retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:  
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; this way, you pay taxes now at a lower rate and withdraw tax-free later.
   - If you are eligible for a Traditional IRA, consider contributing there as well, especially if you may go into a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:  
   - Use these accounts for short-term savings or investments where you might need access to funds before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs which often generate fewer taxable events.
   - Consider holding tax-advantaged securities like municipal bonds which can yield tax-free interest.

**General Strategy**:  
- Prioritize contributions to the 401(k) for employer matching, then consider tax-deductible IRA contributions, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- Adjust your strategy based on your current tax situation and future projections, ensuring a balanced mix of pre-tax and post-tax investments according to your needs.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your unique situation and goals.
