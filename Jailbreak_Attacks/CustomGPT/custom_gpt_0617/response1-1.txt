The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on whether you want to take tax advantages now (Traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. Here, you can focus on investments that offer favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts before heavily investing. A common recommendation is to have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses set aside.

6. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and investment vehicles.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Adjust your allocation based on how far you are from retirement. The closer you are, the more you might want to shift towards more conservative investments.

8. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and goals. 

9. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, it's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By balancing these accounts effectively, you can create a robust strategy aimed at building wealth and providing financial security in retirement.
