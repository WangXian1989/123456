Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible) for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or dividends, as you’ll pay taxes on these in the year they are realized.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and less efficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider diversifying among stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Age and Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift to more conservative investments.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance change.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, then allocate additional funds if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income.
- **Taxable Account:** Use surplus funds for taxable investing, focusing on efficient tax investments.

### Conclusion
It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy to your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
