To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. The growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are funded with after-tax dollars, and while they offer flexibility and liquidity, youâ€™ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your allocation with your risk tolerance and investment goals. For long-term growth, consider a higher allocation to stocks, which tends to be more volatile.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level, taking into account market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account type are diverse across asset classes to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications to optimize your withdrawals from each account type.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
