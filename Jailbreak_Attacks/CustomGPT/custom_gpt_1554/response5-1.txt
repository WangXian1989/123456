Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Always aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals), which can significantly enhance your investment returns over time.

2. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money" that can boost your retirement savings.

3. **Diversify Investments:** In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds or assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon:** If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time to grow your investments, lean more heavily into equities for growth. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more stable investments.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions as needed based on market conditions and your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain, consider working with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

The right allocation can significantly enhance your retirement savings and help you meet your financial goals.
