Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into a taxable investment account. This account offers flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but is subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, aligning with your long-term goals.
   - **IRA**: Similar allocation, but you might be able to include different investments not available in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment performance and asset allocation. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on the complexity of your situation, you may find it beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This balanced approach aims to maximize growth while considering tax implications and your future financial needs.
