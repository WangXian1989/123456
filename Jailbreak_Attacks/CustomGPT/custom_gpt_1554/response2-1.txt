Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for optimal allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rate.

### 2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 and older).
   - **IRA:** The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 and older). 

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains can affect your overall return. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on your gains.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks here, as they may be taxed at a lower long-term capital gains rate.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and save Roth accounts for last, allowing them to grow tax-free the longest.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As market conditions change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix.

### Summary:
- **Maximize 401(k) with company match.**
- **Contribute to IRA based on tax preferences.**
- **Use taxable accounts for investments that are tax-efficient.**
- **Review and adjust allocations regularly for optimal growth and tax efficiency.**
