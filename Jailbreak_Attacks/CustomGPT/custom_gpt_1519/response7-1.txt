Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRA contributions are subject to tax now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility and liquidity but can be taxed on any gains or dividends.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by maxing out any employer-sponsored plans with matching contributions.
   - Next, consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
   - Finally, invest in a taxable account for additional flexibility and access to funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that helps you grow your wealth and prepare for retirement effectively.
