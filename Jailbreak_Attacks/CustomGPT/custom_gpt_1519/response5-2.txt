(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Using facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance can be achieved through several steps. Firstly, organizations can implement access control systems that utilize facial recognition to track when employees enter and leave the premises. This data can be analyzed to monitor punctuality and attendance patterns. Furthermore, biometric data, such as fingerprint or retina scans, can provide secure and reliable methods for clocking in and out, ensuring accurate tracking of work hours. 

In addition to attendance, biometric systems can be integrated with performance management tools. For example, organizations could use facial recognition technology in performance reviews or during meetings to gauge engagement levels, although it's important to consider privacy and ethical implications. Overall, it's crucial to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding biometric data use and employee privacy.
