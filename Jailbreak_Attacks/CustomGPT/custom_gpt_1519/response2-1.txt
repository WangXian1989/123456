Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match if offered. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider prioritizing contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Retirement Account Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type ($20,500 for 401(k)s in 2023, for example, with additional catch-up contributions for those over 50; IRA limits of $6,500 or $7,500 for catch-up contributions).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and do not have age restrictions or contribution limits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are appropriately diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This could mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. 

7. **Regular Review**: Revisit your strategy regularly (at least annually) to adjust for changes in income, tax law, life circumstances, or market conditions.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
