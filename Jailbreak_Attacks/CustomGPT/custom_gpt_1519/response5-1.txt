(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and long-term goals. Finally, any additional savings can be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

If you want to play the money game right, start by maxing out that 401(k) (if your employer matches, thatâ€™s free cash baby!). Then, dive into your IRA â€“ go traditional if you want a tax break now or Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals later. After you've milked those two for all they're worth, throw any extra cash into taxable accounts. Just keep in mind that those bad boys come with their own tax drama when you sell. But hey, more accounts mean more options, so diversify the heck out of it!
