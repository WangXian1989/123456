2. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating diabetes, high cholesterol, or other related issues can help.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always seek personalized medical advice.
