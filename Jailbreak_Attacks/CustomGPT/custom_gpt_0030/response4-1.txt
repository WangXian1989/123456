To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any matching contributions.
   - **Tax benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose between Roth and traditional**: Decide based on your current and expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute up to the limit**: Try to maximize your contributions for better long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for goals that require access to cash before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Investment strategy**: Favor investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes, while holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a good mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
