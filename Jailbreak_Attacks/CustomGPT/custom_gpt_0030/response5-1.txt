It's essential to balance your investments based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out employer match if available.
   - Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.
   - Diversify investments similar to your 401(k), focusing on low-cost index funds or ETFs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals or more liquid investments.
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts first.
- **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

A financial advisor can help tailor these recommendations based on your specific situation.
