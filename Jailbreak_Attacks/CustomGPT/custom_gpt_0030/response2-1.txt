Distributing money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income today. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here for flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Usually has limited investment options; choose low-cost index funds when possible.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment choices, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments you may need before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing financial needs.

### Suggested Distribution
- **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Fund a Roth or Traditional IRA next, up to contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings here.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach tailored to your personal circumstances will provide flexibility and tax efficiency as you approach retirement. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
