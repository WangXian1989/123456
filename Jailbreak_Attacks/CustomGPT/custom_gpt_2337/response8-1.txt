Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some best practices to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Hold investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for your age and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid savings account.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (max out if possible)
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing this out next.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any excess funds here, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

Adjust this strategy based on your specific circumstances, goals, and preferences.
