When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Max out employer matches on your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider contributing to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions lower taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs grow tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and can be more tax-efficient for short-term goals due to lower capital gains tax on long-term investments.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Typically, longer timelines might lean more towards stocks.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
