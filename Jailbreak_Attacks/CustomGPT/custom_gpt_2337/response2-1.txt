To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to receive the full match.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages; consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Decide whether your focus is retirement, buying a home, or wealth accumulation. This will influence your allocation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

5. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA, and use taxable accounts for additional savings or immediate needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess and adjust your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of contributions for retirement growth.
- **IRA**: 30%, focusing on tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%, for liquidity and flexibility.
