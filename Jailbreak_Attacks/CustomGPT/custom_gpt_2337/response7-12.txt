I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be required.

Make sure to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
