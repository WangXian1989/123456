Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and financial timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money you contribute or its earnings until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your tax situation, you might choose to prioritize one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages, but they provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you plan to use the money in the short term, you may want to prioritize a taxable account for easier access without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes in each account type to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances can greatly affect the best distribution method. A professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy should align with your overall financial plan, goals, and tax situation.
