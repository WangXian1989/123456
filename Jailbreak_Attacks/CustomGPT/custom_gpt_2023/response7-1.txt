The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider when deciding on your allocation:

1. **Tax-advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free growth. A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you need to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial for tax deferral. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account may be ideal.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-term Goals**: If you have short-term financial goals (like buying a house or funding a vacation), consider putting funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified to mitigate risk. Invest across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Reassessment**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your current financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions about how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
