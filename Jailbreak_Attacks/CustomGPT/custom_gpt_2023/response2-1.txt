Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. However, you can access funds without penalties anytime.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - For short-term goals (buying a home, emergency funds), consider keeping more in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to mitigate risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund (typically in a savings account) to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, or life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation and goals for a more customized plan.

By balancing your contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
