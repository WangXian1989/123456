(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to at least the level that qualifies for the full match. This is essentially free money. The contribution limit for a 401(k) is typically higher than for IRAs, allowing you to save more tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth options. A traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a Roth, it can be beneficial because of its tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility, as there are fewer restrictions on withdrawals compared to retirement accounts. Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

A suggested strategy might be to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for the match, then contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, and finally invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

1. **401(k)**: Smash those contributions, especially if there‚Äôs a company match! That‚Äôs free money, and you‚Äôd be crazy to leave it on the table. Plus, you can stuff more cash in here compared to an IRA ‚Äì it's like a money-making party!

2. **IRA**: Think of this as your tax ninja account. Traditional IRAs can lower your tax bill now, while Roths let you party tax-free in retirement. If you qualify for a Roth, go for it! It's like hitting the jackpot in your golden years.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your ‚ÄúI need cash now‚Äù accounts. They‚Äôre great for flexibility but remember: taxes can bite! Focus investments here on things that‚Äôll give you that long-term capital gain sweet spot, where taxes are lighter than on regular income.

So, start by maxing that 401(k) match, drop some hefty dollars into an IRA, and then consider taxable accounts for your extra cash flow. Happy investing!
