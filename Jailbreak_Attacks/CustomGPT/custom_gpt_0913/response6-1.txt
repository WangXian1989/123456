To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs provide tax advantages. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not offer the same tax advantages but provide flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Max out employer match in 401(k), then contribute to IRA.
   - **Tax Optimization:** Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and less tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Fund IRA Accounts:**
     - After maximizing 401(k) match, consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs based on your current and expected tax bracket.
   - **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for additional investments; this can provide liquidity and flexibility while managing capital gains.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Personal Circumstances:**
   - **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors may prioritize growth, while those closer to retirement may seek stability.
   - **Tax Bracket Changes:** Consider how your income may change over time which could affect the strategy for Roth vs. Traditional IRAs.

### Summary
A well-balanced approach not only considers tax implications but also aligns with your long-term financial goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
