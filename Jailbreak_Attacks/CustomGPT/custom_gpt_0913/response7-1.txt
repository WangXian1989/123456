When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. You pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. 

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Check the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting additional money into IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your financial goals. If you're saving for long-term retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more suitable.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your investment strategy should reflect your comfort with risk. Diversifying within each account type can help manage this.

**Strategy Example**:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (Roth for tax-free growth if you qualify; traditional if you want a tax deduction now).
3. Use taxable accounts for anything beyond that, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).

Consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored plan can also be beneficial based on your specific situation and goals.
