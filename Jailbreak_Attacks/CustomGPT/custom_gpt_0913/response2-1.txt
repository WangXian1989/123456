Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, prioritize contributions here to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify based on income limits.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies before locking away funds in retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate longer-term investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for short-term needs.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure your risk tolerance aligns with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances and changes in tax laws can significantly affect your strategy; a professional can offer tailored guidance.

Tailoring these strategies to fit your specific situation is crucial for optimal financial growth.
