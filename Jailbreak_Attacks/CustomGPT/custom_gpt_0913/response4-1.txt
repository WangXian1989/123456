Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maximizing contributions to these accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA might make sense.

3. **Diversification**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, diversifying your investments across different accounts can reduce risk. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in your Roth IRA, given the tax-free growth potential.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This typically should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings goals or investments that might generate taxable events (e.g., dividends, capital gains). Consider tax efficiency when choosing investments, such as favoring index funds.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: As you invest, periodically review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial professional to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your retirement accounts and taxable investments.
