When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out employer-matched contributions first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Contribute here if you want tax-deferred growth; consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth stocks in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments like municipal bonds or index funds, which can be more tax-efficient.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Align the risk level of your investments with your time horizon and financial goals.
   - Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks than those closer to retirement.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and prioritize contributions accordingly.
   - For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 ($30,500 for those aged 50+), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those aged 50+).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk better.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Consider the fees associated with each investment and account type as they can impact overall returns.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts with tax strategies and your financial goals in mind, you can optimize your overall investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
