Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Contribution**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax in a Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide based on your current tax rate vs. projected future rates. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (long-term) and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, useful for short-term goals.

### 4. **General Allocation Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before heavy investing.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account type, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Considerations**
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts can be tax-free.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments, while shorter ones might necessitate more conservative choices.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your unique situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balance contributions based on your priorities, ensuring you're taking full advantage of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity for your needs. Regular reviews will keep your distributions aligned with your evolving goals.
