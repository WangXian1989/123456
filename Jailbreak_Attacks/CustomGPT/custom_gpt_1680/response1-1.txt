Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so consider maximizing contributions here first.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or to a traditional IRA for potential upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. This is where you’ll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, so be mindful of tax-efficient investment strategies.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and potential penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.
