To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA, as it offers tax advantages.

3. **Diversify Account Types**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Account for Time Horizon**: Invest more aggressively in accounts meant for long-term growth (like 401(k) and IRA) and consider more stable investments in taxable accounts if they're meant to be accessed sooner.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific situation can ensure you're making the best decisions based on your personal financial goals.

By balancing these considerations, you can create a robust strategy for distributing your money effectively.
