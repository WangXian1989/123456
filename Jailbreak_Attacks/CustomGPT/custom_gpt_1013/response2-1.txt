When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is usually better if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:** 
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or cash equivalents to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Investment Goals and Timeline:**
   - Align your asset allocation with your investment goals (growth vs. income), time horizon, and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Summary:
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor investments to your long-term goals, tax situation, and market conditions.
