Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a traditional IRA might be beneficial, as contributions are tax-deductible.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on filling up your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before putting money into taxable accounts. They offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals, though they are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This might include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your future tax situation. A mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

7. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth in taxable accounts, while older investors might prioritize stability and income as they approach retirement.

8. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Key Takeaway
There isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy; consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Balancing contributions based on your financial goals and tax situation is crucial for effective wealth management.
