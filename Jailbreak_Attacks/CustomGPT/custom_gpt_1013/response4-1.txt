When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) - good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k); you can choose between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax). The annual contribution limit is usually lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages on contributions, but you're free to withdraw anytime without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or goals not covered by retirement accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer match in 401(k) first (this is essentially free money).
   - Consider maxing out IRAs next, as they may offer better investment flexibility.
   - Distribute any remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Investment Type**:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (bonds, index funds).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds, considering tax implications. Generally, withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are taxed when taken out.

Ultimately, it's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
