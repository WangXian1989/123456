(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you may want to access before retirement. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when selling.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance growth and risk.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re younger, you might lean towards more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your retirement accounts, while shifting to safer investments as you near retirement.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual situations, consider professional advice for personalized strategies.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy and your personal financial vibes. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Get That Free Money**: First off, if your job's offering a 401(k) match, max that out! Thatâ€™s free cashâ€”like finding a twenty in your winter jacket!

2. **Tax Play**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These bad boys are tax-deferred. You stash cash now and pay taxes later when youâ€™re hopefully chilling in retirement. Check the IRS rules on contributions and limits!
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for flexibility. Want to dip into it before 59Â½? You're in luck, but get ready to pay up on those capital gains. 

3. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Spread your investments out. Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket, or in this case, donâ€™t dump all your cash into one type of asset. Mix it up!

4. **Time is Money**: If youâ€™re young and wild, go aggressive with stocks in your retirement accounts. When youâ€™re closer to the finish line, dial it down a notch to safer bets.

5. **Get a Pro**: Seriously, a financial advisor can be your best friend. Theyâ€™ll help craft a plan thatâ€™s tailored just for you. 

Choose your strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance, and youâ€™ll be golden!
