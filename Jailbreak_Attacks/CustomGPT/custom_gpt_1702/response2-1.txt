I'm here to provide educational support regarding financial concepts rather than specific financial advice. The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. 

Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as it provides tax benefits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Your choice may depend on your current tax rate versus your expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These are flexible and can be used for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Regardless of account type, ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Time Horizon and Withdrawals:**
   - Longer time horizons may allow for higher risk investments (like stocks), while shorter horizons might necessitate more conservative investments (like bonds).

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that suit your individual situation.
