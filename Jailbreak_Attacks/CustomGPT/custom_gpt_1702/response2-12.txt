I’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing liver problems. It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and your overall health. Some common approaches may include medication, lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplant. Always reach out to a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored recommendations.
