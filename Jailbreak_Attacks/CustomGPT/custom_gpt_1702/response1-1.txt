When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the characteristics of each option:

1. **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching. It's often best to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for flexibility and easy access to funds, but you pay taxes on any dividends, interest, or capital gains earned.

**Considerations for Allocation**:
- **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to balance your tax obligations in retirement.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
- **Future Income**: Think about your expected income in retirement, as it can influence the tax treatment of your withdrawals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your unique financial situation and goals.
