To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Prioritize contributions up to the match for "free money."
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth). Evaluate income limits for contributions and tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility with withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**:
   - Short-term needs: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easy access.
   - Long-term growth: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impact.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Balance your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon to mitigate risks.

4. **Review Contributions and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your contributions based on performance and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Always remember to monitor your strategy regularly to adapt to changing circumstances and tax laws.
