Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer. This is essentially free money and should be a priority in your savings plan.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you need the tax deduction now.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This helps to reduce your taxable income now and grow your investments tax-deferred.

4. **Investment in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have additional funds beyond your retirement accounts, consider investing them in a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though you'll have to consider the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**: Consider your time horizon and specific financial goals (e.g., retirement age, buying a home, children’s education). This may affect how aggressively you invest and the specific investments you choose.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Over time, the market may change the balance of your investments across accounts. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
