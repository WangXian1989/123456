Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to start.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, which need to be considered for longer-term holdings.

3. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to balance risk and return.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating too much to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible taxable account for unexpected expenses.

5. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you have short-term goals (e.g., down payment for a house), prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50 and over), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and over).

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations as needed to stay on track with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best meets your needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial objectives.
