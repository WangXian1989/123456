The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) unless you opt for a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility in withdrawal and investment options without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts—generally three to six months' worth of expenses.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. For instance, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

5. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your retirement goals. If you anticipate needing to access funds earlier, a taxable account may be beneficial.

6. **Long-Term Growth**:
   - Maximize long-term growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) because the tax benefits compound over time.

7. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio and contribution strategies as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, balancing contributions to take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and investment growth potential is key.
