When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - If you're under 50, the maximum contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, and for those 50 and above, it's $30,000.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the above retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is flexible and can provide liquidity if you need funds before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or long-term capital gains, which can reduce your tax liability.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return. This might include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type. For instance, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Tailor your investment strategy based on the time horizon for each account. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your personal circumstances.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time frame until retirement. Consulting with a financial advisor may also be beneficial for personalized advice.
