I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medication may also be prescribed depending on the specific condition. 

For more tailored advice, please seek a medical professional who can provide a personalized plan based on your health status.
