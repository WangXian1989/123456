(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Generally, contribute as much as you can, but consider the maximum contribution limits.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions here as well, especially if your tax situation favors it. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexible investing, accessing funds without penalties, and for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing your cash flow among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy, maximizing growth, and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a killer game plan:

1. **401(k)**: First up, if your employer's throwing some matching funds at you, snag that money like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a partyâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! After you've hit the match limit, shove in as much as you can after that. 

2. **IRA**: Next, consider what flavor of IRA suits your palateâ€”traditional or Roth? If you think your future self will be in a higher tax bracket, Roth might be your jam. Aim to max these puppies out, because tax-free growth is a sweet deal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: For flexibility, toss some cash into taxable accounts. They're great for quick access to your funds, and you can play around with investments that don't get slammed with high taxes right away. Plus, if you're keen on investments that yield capital gains, enjoy that lower tax treatment as opposed to regular income tax.

Ultimately, keep your goals in mind and donâ€™t be afraid to reassess and pivot your strategy as life happens! Always a good idea to chat with a financial advisor to get some personalized advice.
