Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts hinges on several factors including your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax considerations. Here’s a breakdown of strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't already, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit after reaching your IRA contribution limits.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. Familiarize yourself with these limits to get the most out of each account.

4. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds and real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep investments with lower tax implications, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, in your taxable accounts, since they are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset classes can help minimize risk and enhance returns.

6. **Adjust for Your Time Horizon**: If you have long-term goals (retirement, etc.), you might favor more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to meet your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and personal circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always keep in mind the importance of maintaining an emergency fund and ensuring liquidity for unexpected expenses.
