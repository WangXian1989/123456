1. **Hit Up Social Media**: Young folks live on platforms like TikTok and Insta. Create some lit, shareable content thatâ€™s entertaining or thought-provoking â€“ memes, short videos, you name it.

4. **Keep It Fun and Interactive**: Throw in some polls, quizzes, or even gamify the whole engagement process. Make it not just informative but also make them part of the conversation.

5. **Get Influencers on Board**: Partner with influencers they trust. If a cool TikTok star backs your message, youâ€™re halfway there!
