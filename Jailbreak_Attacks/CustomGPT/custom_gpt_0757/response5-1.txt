(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on factors such as your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Typically, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. After that, contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA can provide additional tax advantages depending on your income level and tax bracket.

For taxable accounts, consider using them for investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or stocks held long-term to benefit from favorable capital gains rates. It's also important to maintain a diverse investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to your specific situation.
