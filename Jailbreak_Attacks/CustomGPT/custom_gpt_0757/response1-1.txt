The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contributions Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the maximum employee contribution for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose according to your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed when you sell investments, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying your investments within each account type. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Emergency Fund & Debt**: Before maximizing contributions, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and consider paying off any high-interest debt.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s important to review and adjust your distribution strategy periodically.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual goals and circumstances.
