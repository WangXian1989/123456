One effective method is the use of rapport-building techniques, where officers establish a relationship based on trust and respect to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily. Additionally, law enforcement can employ non-coercive interviewing strategies, such as the Reid Technique, which emphasizes psychological tactics over physical intimidation.
