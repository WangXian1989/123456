Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the annual limit (for 2023, it’s $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50) to benefit from tax deferrals. Consider whether a traditional or Roth option is better based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (annual limit of $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50) to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Use a Taxable Account for Flexibility:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional savings. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you expect to need access to funds before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Generally suitable for higher-growth investments (stocks) since taxes on gains are deferred.
   - **Roth IRA:** Can hold a mix of investments since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is useful for assets expected to appreciate significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments that generate lower tax implications, such as index funds, ETFs, and municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, life goals, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consider Taxes:**
   - Be mindful of capital gains when selling assets in taxable accounts and think about tax implications of withdrawals from retirement accounts after you start taking distributions.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation and help you balance growth with tax efficiency.
