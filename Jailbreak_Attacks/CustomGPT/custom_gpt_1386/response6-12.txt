I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It’s critical to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferon or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Supportive Treatments**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications to manage symptoms (like diuretics for fluid retention) may be needed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - **Check-Ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, options such as liver transplantation or procedures to reduce pressure in the portal vein may be considered.

Always work with your healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific condition.
