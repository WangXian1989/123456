When structuring your investment across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on the investments available in your plan that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Maximize contributions to an IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free. Use more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts, as interest income is taxable.

3. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions. Also, consider holding tax-exempt bonds in taxable accounts if applicable.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and tax laws. Adjust contributions and investments as your financial situation evolves.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to mitigate risk. Ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your long-term financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement based on tax implications to minimize your tax burden during retirement.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
