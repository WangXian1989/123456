Distributing your money effectively between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000, plus an additional $7,500 if you’re over 50.
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 per year, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments can be taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest, but you have more flexibility in accessing this money without penalties.

4. **Priority Order**:
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) match first.
   - Then contribute to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you qualify, for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - After maxing out both accounts, invest any additional funds in a taxable account for flexibility and to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - More aggressive, higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, where long-term growth is prioritized.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: As your income, tax situation, or financial goals change, review and adjust your contributions accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
