Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can impact your retirement savings and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** Contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older).
  
### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to manage your tax bracket effectively, often favoring tax-deferred accounts first.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution
1. **First, maximize 401(k) contributions to get the full employer match.**
2. **Next, fund any IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible for potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.**
3. **Finally, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments and tax efficiency.**

This approach balances tax benefits, employer incentives, and flexibility in accessing funds. Consider reviewing your strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.
