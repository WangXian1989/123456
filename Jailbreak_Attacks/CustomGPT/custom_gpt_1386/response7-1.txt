Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 401(k)
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits**: The annual limit is typically higher than IRAs, so if you're able, contribute up to the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).

### IRA (Traditional or Roth)
- **Choose the Right Type**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket and retirement goals, one may be more beneficial than the other.
- **Contribute Annually**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500 for 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

### Taxable Accounts
- **Use for Shorter-Term Goals**: If you have goals within the next 5â€“10 years, such as buying a house or funding education, consider saving in a taxable account for liquidity.
- **Invest Wisely**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains for more favorable tax treatment.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing.
3. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for the employer match.
- After that, contribute to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- Use any leftover money for your taxable accounts, focusing on liquid and tax-efficient investments.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
For personalized advice tailored to your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor. They can help you navigate complex tax implications and investment strategies.
