Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). You might consider increasing contributions if you’re aiming for a higher percentage of your salary.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, fund a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement, and it can be beneficial for investing in assets that are more tax efficient (like index funds).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you maintain an appropriate asset allocation within each account, taking into consideration their tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
