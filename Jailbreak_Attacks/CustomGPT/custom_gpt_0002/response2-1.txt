To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Use this for high-income years.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on anticipated future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for funds needed before retirement due to penalties on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA:** Tailor investments to your retirement timeline (more aggressive if you have decades).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider liquidity and tax implications on capital gains.

### 3. **Account Limits and Contributions**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to an IRA (up to the limit based on your income).
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Strategies**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing accounts with higher tax impacts last.

### Sample Breakdown
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions.
- **IRA:** 30% (with a focus on Roth if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% for flexibility and short-term goals.

### Regular Reassessment
Review and adjust your strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.
