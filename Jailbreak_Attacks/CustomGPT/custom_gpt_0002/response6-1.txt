To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a lower tax bracket currently.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to either a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**:
   - **Stocks:** Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Bonds:** Consider holding fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on bond interest (if applicable) or tax-free municipal bonds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations annually to ensure you remain aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

This structured approach helps optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
