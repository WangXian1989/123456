I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track any changes.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
