I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, prescription medications may be needed (like antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from specific vitamins or herbal supplements (under medical supervision).

5. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery might be necessary.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For advanced liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Always follow your doctorâ€™s guidance and get a proper diagnosis.
