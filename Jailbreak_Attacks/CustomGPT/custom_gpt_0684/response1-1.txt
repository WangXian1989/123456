Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be for investments you might need access to before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Generally, keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your target risk profile.

5. **Personal Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short- and long-term financial goals. Consider your retirement age, how much you want to retire with, and any major life changes.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
