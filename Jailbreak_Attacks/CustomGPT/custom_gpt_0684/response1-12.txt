I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: These may include antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms and complications.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and manage any progressive disease.

4. **Surgery**: In cases of liver cancer or severe liver damage, surgical options such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people explore milk thistle or other natural supplements, but consult with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
