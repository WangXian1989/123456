I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet low in fat and sugar, regular exercise, and weight management can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes (like hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Staying away from alcohol and avoiding exposure to harmful substances can help protect the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be required to monitor liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if the liver is failing.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
