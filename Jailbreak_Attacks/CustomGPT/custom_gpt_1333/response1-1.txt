Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), with potential tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Fees and Investment Options**: Compare the fees and investment choices in your 401(k) versus your IRA. Sometimes IRAs have better investment options.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Future Tax Considerations**: Consider your expected tax rate in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.
