The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This offers tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Aim to maximize your IRA contributions if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferral. Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
