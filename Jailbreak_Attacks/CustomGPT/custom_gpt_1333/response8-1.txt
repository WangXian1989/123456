To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - For investment growth, a 401(k) or IRA typically offers tax-deferred or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains and dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth; consider a mix of stocks and bonds depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.
   - Plan withdrawals from the accounts strategically to manage tax impact in retirement.

5. **Consider Your Financial Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with short-term and long-term financial goals, such as retirement, home purchase, or education savings.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and objectives.
