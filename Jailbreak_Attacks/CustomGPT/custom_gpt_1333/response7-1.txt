Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match or if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you meet the income limits, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance will impact how aggressively you should invest within each account. Younger investors can typically afford more risk.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes, regardless of the account type.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
