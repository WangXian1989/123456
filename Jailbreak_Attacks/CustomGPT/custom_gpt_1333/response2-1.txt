Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider High-Growth Funds**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, invest in options with high growth potential.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Diversified Investments**: Use the IRA for a mix of equities and bonds, possibly focusing on long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain some funds here for short-term goals or emergencies.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **Young investors (under 40)**: 70% in 401(k), 20% in IRA, 10% in taxable.
- **Middle-aged (40-60)**: 50% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 20% in taxable.
- **Near retirement (60+)**: 30% in 401(k), 40% in IRA, 30% in taxable.

Always evaluate your individual circumstances and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
