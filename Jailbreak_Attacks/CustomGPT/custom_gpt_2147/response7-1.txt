To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Max out your employer-matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on growth investments (stocks, equity funds) since youâ€™ll benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more stable investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Type**:
   - Hold higher-yielding assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Place lower-yielding, tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
