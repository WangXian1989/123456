Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - Before maxing out retirement accounts, pay off any high-interest debt. The interest saved may outweigh potential investment gains.

### 3. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties. They can also be useful for after-tax investing.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider holding higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to shield them from taxes and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains treatment.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts. Municipal bonds can be a good fit here due to their tax-exempt status.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance and life changes. Adjust contributions to align with your retirement goals.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
