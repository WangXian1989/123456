Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate capital gains, such as stocks, which are taxed at lower rates if held long-term. Use these for more flexible investments once you max out tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: If you have a long time until retirement, consider aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For any money you might need in the next few years, keep it in more liquid, less volatile investments within your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Use each type of account to diversify across asset classes. For instance, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities on interest income.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Review**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure youâ€™re on track to meet your goals and that your allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution
- Maximize 401(k) contributions to 15%.
- Contribute up to $6,500 in a Roth or Traditional IRA.
- Allocate the remaining funds into a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Final Consideration
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances, especially to consider things like fees, the potential impact of market volatility, and changes in retirement plans.
