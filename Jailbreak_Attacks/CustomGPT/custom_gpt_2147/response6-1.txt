Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Determine how much risk youâ€™re willing to take. Generally, aggressive investments (like stocks) are better suited for long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Optimize for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan withdrawals for retirement strategically to manage your taxable income.

### 4. **Regular Reviews**
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and make adjustments based on life changes or market conditions.

### Conclusion
- **Start with employer match** in your 401(k), then fund your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

This approach helps maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
