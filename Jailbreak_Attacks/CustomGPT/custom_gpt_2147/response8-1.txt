To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available) to maximize free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - Higher tax brackets might favor traditional accounts for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - Allocate safer, income-generating investments (bonds, dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough in cash or liquid assets to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
