3. **Engagement Campaigns**: Organize events, rallies, and discussions that invite participation and provide a platform for them to voice their opinions.

4. **Utilize Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who have a strong following among youth to amplify your message and reach.

5. **Highlight Voting Accessibility**: Provide information on how to register and vote, emphasizing the ease and importance of participation in elections.

6. **Interactive Content**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive posts to engage them and encourage sharing.
