To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for bonds and income-generating investments, as these are taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor long-term capital gains investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (plus $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus $1,000 if age 50+).

4. **Diversification**: Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering your tax situation, taking money first from taxable accounts for lower tax impact.

### Example Distribution
- Max out 401(k) contributions for employer match.
- Fund IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Allocate remaining investments to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Regular Review
Reassess your strategy periodically based on changing financial situations or tax laws.
