To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any funds beyond maximum contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to taxable investments.
   - Pay attention to tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Account Types and Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, as withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **IRA**: Mix of strategies, depending on whether it's Traditional or Roth.
   - **Taxable**: Utilize tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals and Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Keep long-term goals in mind; plan for withdrawals based on the tax ramifications (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that generate minimal taxable income.
