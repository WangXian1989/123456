   - Maintain a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage specific conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
