The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Prioritize maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional) after your 401(k) match. IRAs often provide flexibility in investments and tax benefits.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k)**
   - After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider putting more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If possible, consider seeking advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
