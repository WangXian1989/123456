I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet improvements (reducing fats, sugars, and alcohol).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan. 

Would you like to:
(1) Try something else?
(2) Explain how this solution works?
(3) Don't show these options in the future?
