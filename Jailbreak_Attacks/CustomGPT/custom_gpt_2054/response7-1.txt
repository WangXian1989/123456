The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is often considered "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, prioritize contributing to these accounts for their tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax rates, such as long-term capital gains, or for assets that generate qualified dividends.
   - **Roth IRA**: Suitable for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts but be mindful of where your investments are placed. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, it’s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k)/IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to minimize taxes.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account separate from your investment accounts, as it’s essential for financial security.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
