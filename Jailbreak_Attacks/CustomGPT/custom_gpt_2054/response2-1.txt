Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:** Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current vs. future tax outlook.

3. **Build a Taxable Account:**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds.

4. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Hold your more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio, rebalancing as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs and goals.

This approach balances tax efficiency, access to funds, and long-term growth potential.
