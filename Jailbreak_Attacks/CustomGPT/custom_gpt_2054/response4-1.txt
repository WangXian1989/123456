Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: After the match and IRA contributions, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatments, like long-term capital gains, or if you expect to need funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities might be held in tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their interest being taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications when selecting investments for each account type. For example, high-growth investments might do well in tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments may be better in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your allocations and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
