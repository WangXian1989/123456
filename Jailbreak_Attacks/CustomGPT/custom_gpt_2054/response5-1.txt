(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might want to prioritize contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to your IRA (either Roth or traditional) for tax advantages, depending on your eligibility and preferences.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments. These accounts offer more flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

Consider balancing your investments across these accounts in line with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

Finally, toss any leftover funds into your **taxable accounts**. Theyâ€™re trickier with taxes, but they offer flexibility when you want to access those funds without penalties.
