The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you have a good match, contribute enough to get that match. Then, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This is great for tax-deductible contributions if you're eligible. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these after maxing out contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties and offer capital gains tax advantages.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Continuously review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
