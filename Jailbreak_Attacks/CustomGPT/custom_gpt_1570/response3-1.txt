The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with additional catch-up contributions allowed if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRAs are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts. If you think your tax bracket will be lower, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement. These can also benefit from long-term capital gains treatment if held for over a year.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your individual circumstances and goals.
