Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs to make the most of these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure you’re diversifying your investments to manage risk. You may want to include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Balancing contributions among these accounts can help you manage taxes in retirement.

5. **After-Tax Investments**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains (which are taxed more favorably) or for investments you might need access to before retirement. 

6. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy based on your specific circumstances.
