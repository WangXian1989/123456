Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s free money!

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)/IRA:** Aim to max out contributions:
     - For 2023, that’s $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.
   - These can offer flexibility and easier access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Choices:**
   - **401(k)/IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets (e.g., stocks, index funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if qualified.
   - Monitor your taxable account for capital gains and losses.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Adjust allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency to optimize retirement savings.
