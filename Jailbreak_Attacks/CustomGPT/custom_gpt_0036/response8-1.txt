Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing.

3. **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, which may benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **401(k) Contributions:** After IRA contributions, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, particularly if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments. They provide flexibility, but consider tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Regularly Reassess:** Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they still align with your goals.
