Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your tax bracket and tax strategy. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs give you tax deductions upfront.

### 3. **Balance Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Money grows tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Yield dividends and capital gains that are taxable in the year they're received.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Typically, you might want to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax efficiency, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Revisit your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have liquidity for emergencies, which may affect how much you allocate to each account.
