Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed each year and capital gains are taxed at a lower rate when investments are held long-term.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Use your taxable account for short-term needs or investments that generate dividends or interest, while holding growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, while reserving taxable accounts for more flexible goals (like buying a home).

6. **Retirement Withdrawals**: Strategize future withdrawals to minimize tax implications. For example, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Balancing these accounts strategically can enhance your overall financial health.
