Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you're on track for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings, liquidity, or investments in assets that may generate favorable capital gains taxes (like stocks held long-term).
   - Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as index funds or ETFs.

### Strategy Balancing
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-tax investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like high-yield bonds) and lower-tax investments in taxable accounts (like stocks).
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to manage risk.

### Regular Review
- Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust according to changes in your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
