To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use for income-generating assets for tax efficiency.

### 2. **Establish Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts based on when youâ€™ll need the funds.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

### 3. **Consider the Contribution Limits**
   - Max out employer match on your 401(k) before contributing to an IRA.
   - Adjust contributions based on annual limits for each account type.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Asset Location**: Place bonds and income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Monitor your allocations yearly to ensure alignment with your goals and adjust contributions accordingly.

By leveraging these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across various accounts for long-term financial growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
