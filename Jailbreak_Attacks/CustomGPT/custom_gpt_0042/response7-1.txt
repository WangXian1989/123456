Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

### 2. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes and the tax treatment of withdrawals from each type of account.
  
### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your investments and contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.
