Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (whichever suits your income level and tax situation) after maximizing your 401(k) match. 
   - Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) fits your future tax strategy.

3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and if you’re close to retirement and need flexibility.
   - Focus on long-term capital gains investments (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - For long-term goals, favor tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term needs, ensure liquidity in taxable accounts.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Review your asset allocation and re-balance as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

**Additional Tips**:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
- Keep an eye on market conditions and contribution limits to maximize growth opportunities.
