To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (or Roth IRA) next, as they offer tax advantages. Determine if you're eligible for a Roth IRA based on your income.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). Aim to reach the annual contribution limits if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can include investments in low-turnover funds or stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: When planning for withdrawals in retirement, remember that funds from different account types are taxed differently.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
