To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if your employer matches. Consider traditional versus Roth based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are often preferable for younger investors due to tax-free growth.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for easier access to funds. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Focus on growth investments there since they can benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Annual Review**: Reassess your strategy annually, adjusting contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking to a financial advisor who can create a tailored plan based on your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
