Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts with higher limits and tax benefits.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need in the short to medium term, investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you’ll access these funds in retirement. Generally, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, retirement goals, and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) (especially to get matching) and IRA first.
- Use taxable accounts wisely for short-term needs and invest in tax-efficient vehicles.
- Regularly reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes.
