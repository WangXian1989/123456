Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer matching and has higher contribution limits. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA:** Can be a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible):** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** If possible, increase contributions to meet annual maximums.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts should focus on long-term growth investments, as taxes are deferred or minimized.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) that minimize capital gains, or consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and the time frame until you need to access the funds.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Conclusion:
Every financial situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy suited to your specific profile.
