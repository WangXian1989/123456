Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—a free return on your investment. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize growth (higher risk/reward) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversify Within Each Account**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk.

5. **Adjust Based on Income and Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you’re in a lower bracket now, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and account contributions to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and tax situation.
