Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. Then, aim to max out contributions if possible, as they offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and short-term goals. They won't have the same tax advantages, but they allow for accessing funds without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
