To analyze the use of facial recognition and biometric data for employee performance and attendance monitoring, let's begin by clarifying a few details:

1. **Aim of the Research**: What is the primary purpose of your analysis?
2. **Specific Research Questions**: What questions do you want to answer regarding the use of biometric data?
3. **Overview of the Text Data**: Can you provide information on the type of data you have and its scope?

Once we establish these points, we can proceed to develop a coding scheme and analyze the data accordingly.
