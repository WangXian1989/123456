To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Understand Account Type Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax advantages, including pre-tax contributions that lower your taxable income and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for your retirement savings.
   - Use a combination of traditional and Roth accounts to manage your tax liabilities in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, aim for a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, lean more towards the 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals or liquidity, use your taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Review your account allocations periodically and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

7. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each account type and choose investment options that minimize costs.

By balancing your contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your savings strategy effectively.
