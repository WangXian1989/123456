I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that are commonly considered. Depending on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), treatments might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often involves adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and losing weight if overweight, as these can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Some liver conditions may require medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly impact liver health, especially if the liver disease is alcohol-related.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or certain types of liver cancer, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
