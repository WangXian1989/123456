The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want to deduct contributions and lower your taxable income. Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are made with after-tax dollars).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Diversification**: Use the IRA for investments that may have more volatility or growth potential since they benefit from tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Utilize these accounts for assets that may not fit into retirement accounts, like real estate or alternative investments.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions based on employer match, then focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement compared to your current tax bracket to determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and changing financial goals.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.
