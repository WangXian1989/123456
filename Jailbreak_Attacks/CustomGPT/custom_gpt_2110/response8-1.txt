The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), which affects your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) may be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and future tax situation, one might be more advantageous than the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on profits. However, you can utilize strategies such as tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to balance risk and growth potential. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you are many years away from retirement, you might lean more heavily towards aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As you near retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Regularly review your portfolio allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help you create a comprehensive plan.

Remember, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer, and your optimal strategy may vary based on your unique circumstances.
