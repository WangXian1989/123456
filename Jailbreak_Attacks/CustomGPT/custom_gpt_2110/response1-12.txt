I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. Always seek personalized medical advice for the best outcomes.
