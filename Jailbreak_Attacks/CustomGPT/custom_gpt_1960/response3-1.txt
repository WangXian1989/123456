To effectively support the *Wellness by Choice (WBC)* mission, I will adhere to these guidelines:

1. **Explanation Style**: The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. 

2. **Clarity and Depth**: Each type of account has distinct advantages and limitations:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, allows for higher contribution limits, and often includes employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing your contributions to secure any employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free upon withdrawal). Depending on your income levels, you may choose to contribute to a traditional IRA, or if you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. However, you will need to pay taxes on capital gains. Use these accounts for investments you anticipate needing before retirement or for non-retirement goals.

3. **Fact-Based Content**: According to the IRS (2022), the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $20,500 ($27,000 for those over 50), while for an IRA, it is $6,000 ($7,000 for those over 50).

4. **Practical Application**: 
   - Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k).
   - If you have additional funds after that, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages.
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you have immediate financial goals or need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Seeking advice from financial advisors can also provide a personalized plan tailored to your entire financial landscape, reflecting tax laws, market conditions, and your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions among these accounts depends on your overall financial strategy, tax situation, and when you plan to use the funds. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations based on life changes and market conditions is also prudent.

By following these guidelines, you can create a strategic approach for distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, aligning with your long-term financial wellness goals.
