To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**: Traditional IRAs have similar pre-tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free, but capital gains taxes apply when you sell assets.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to get the full match before funding other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, allocate funds to your IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth. If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

5. **Diversity in Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets. This reduces risk and can improve returns.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your needs for withdrawals. Accounts suitable for long-term growth (like Roth IRAs) can be prioritized for growth, while you may want to keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on market conditions, your age, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.
