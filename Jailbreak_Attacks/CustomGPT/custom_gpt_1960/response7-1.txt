To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money. Prioritize maximizing your contributions to take full advantage of any employer matches.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional). If your income is eligible, a Roth IRA can be advantageous as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits, as contributions are often tax-deductible. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for greater flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments at a profit.

4. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**: Ensure that you are properly diversified across all accounts. Consider different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Balance risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to the tax implications of each account type. Generally, higher-growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on appreciation.

6. **Regular Reviews & Adjustments**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your retirement goals and market conditions. Adjust as needed based on performance and changes in financial goals or life situations.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your individual financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies to optimize your investments across accounts effectively.

By adopting a strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can enhance your long-term financial growth while managing tax liabilities.
