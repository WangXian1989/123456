To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Characteristics of Each Account Type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Many employers offer a match, which is essentially free money for retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications vary significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties. However, you will owe taxes on any dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then max out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the maximum contributions are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).
   - **Bedroom Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or actively managed funds) in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in your taxable accounts.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.
   - **Regularly Rebalance**: Monitor the performance of your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. Create a Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement:
   - **Understand Withdrawals**: Plan which accounts to draw from first during retirement to minimize tax implications. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later in retirement.

### Practical Application:
   - Review your current financial situation, assess your risk tolerance, and create a budget to allocate funds efficiently across these accounts.
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Strategically distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the tax implications, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, and maintaining a diversified portfolio. Regular monitoring and adjustment are key to optimizing your investment strategy.
