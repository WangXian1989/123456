(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following approaches:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they offer a matching contribution. This can provide tax advantages and help you save for retirement.

2. **IRA**: Diversify by contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your current and expected tax rates. The Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth, while the Traditional IRA may offer current tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This account can offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

Assess your overall financial picture regularly and adjust as needed based on life changes or financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so when it comes to divvying up your dough between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's like assembling the ultimate investment squad. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: First off, max that puppy out if your employer matches. It's free money, like a bonus level in a gameâ€”donâ€™t skip it! 

2. **IRA**: Next, toss some cash into either a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you're looking to go tax-free later, a Roth is like a golden ticket, but if you want to shave off some tax bucks today, go for the Traditional.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Last but not least, throw some money into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just remember, you want to park investments here that have a chance to grow without getting hit hard by short-term taxes.

Keep an eye on the whole picture and shift things around as your life and goals change!
