When distributing assets among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Maximize contributions here first, as investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate low turnover or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax brackets. Withdraw from taxable first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (with potential for capital gains) in tax-deferred accounts and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial, as they can take your entire financial situation into account.
