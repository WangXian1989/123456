When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA before funding your taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Although they lack the same tax benefits, they offer more flexibility. Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type, reflecting your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, investment performance, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity and individual nature of investments and tax implications, consider seeking advice from a professional to tailor a plan specific to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among these accounts effectively.
