When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Invest in tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA before putting more money into taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow without immediate tax burdens.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might mean different asset allocations based on the account type (more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, possibly more conservative in taxable accounts).

4. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, place investments that generate less frequent income (like stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes, while keeping high-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you'll need to access your money. For early retirement, tap into taxable accounts first before moving to tax-deferred accounts to avoid penalties.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
