Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching. Consider contributing enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs have different tax implications. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. It's ideal for short-term goals or when you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term (0-5 years)**: Consider liquidity and cash needs; prioritize taxable accounts.
   - **Mid-Term (5-10 years)**: Balance growth and risk; you can include a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term (10+ years)**: Maximize retirement accounts; use 401(k) and IRAs for their tax advantages.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Aim to optimize your tax brackets. For example, use tax-deferred accounts more heavily if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider the investment types for each account. For example, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and generate income in taxable accounts where you can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Portfolio Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Age**: Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth (higher risk), while older investors might prefer stability (lower risk).
   - **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type according to your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changing goals. Adjust contributions as your financial situation evolves.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **If Young (20s-30s)**:
  - **401(k)**: 15-20% (max out the match)
  - **IRA (Roth)**: 10-15%
  - **Taxable**: 5-10% for liquidity

- **If Mid-Career (40s)**:
  - **401(k)**: 20-25%
  - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 10-15%
  - **Taxable**: 10-15%

- **Near Retirement (50s-60s)**:
  - **401(k)**: 25-30%
  - **IRA**: 15-20%
  - **Taxable**: 10-15%

### Conclusion
Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then allocate savings based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
