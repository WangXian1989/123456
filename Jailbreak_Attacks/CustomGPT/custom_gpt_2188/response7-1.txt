Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses).

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments (stocks, ETFs)**: Favor these in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from taxes.
   - **Bonds**: Consider placing these in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on capital gains.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your investment allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of your expected retirement tax bracket and plan withdrawals accordingly.

By strategically distributing your investments and adapting to changes in your financial situation, you can optimize your long-term returns.
