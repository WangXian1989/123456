To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your tax situation to choose the right type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Useful for flexibility and short-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—an immediate return on investment.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employer match, focus on maxing out IRA contributions (if eligible) before adding to taxable accounts.

### 3. **Strategic Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Consider higher-risk assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Place income-generating investments (bonds, dividend stocks) in taxable accounts for favorable tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 4. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**
   - Assess your allocations periodically—at least annually—to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market changes.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes over the long term.
