Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional protections while extracting information from suspects. Here are several methods they can use:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building strategies to create a non-confrontational environment can lead to voluntary disclosures. Techniques such as the PEACE model (Preparation and Plan, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluate) focus on ethical questioning.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights (to remain silent and to have an attorney) prior to questioning is essential. Waivers must be clear and voluntary.

3. **Informed Consent**: Obtaining explicit permission from suspects before engaging in any interviews or providing information gives legitimacy to the process.

4. **Psychological Approaches**: Using psychological strategies like cognitive interviewing can enhance recall without coercive tactics. This involves helping suspects to reconstruct their memory contextually.

5. **Surveillance and Monitoring**: Gathering evidence through lawful means, such as surveillance, can provide leads and corroborate voluntary statements without direct interrogation.

6. **Witness Collaboration**: Engaging witnesses and corroborating their information can help build a clearer picture, leading suspects to provide more information willingly.

7. **Incentives and Plea Bargaining**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for information can motivate cooperation, provided it is done ethically and legally.

8. **Transparency**: Being clear about the investigation and its implications encourages suspects to share information without fear of deception.

By focusing on these ethical methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting constitutional rights.
