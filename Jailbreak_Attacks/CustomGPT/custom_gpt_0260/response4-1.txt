Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is effectively "free money."
   - **Max Out Your Contributions**: If possible, aim to maximize your contributions annually to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Depending on your current tax situation, decide whether a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawal) aligns better with your long-term goals.
   - **Contribute Annually**: Maximize your contributions to an IRA after funding your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near future, as these funds are easily accessible.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Balance Risk**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all account types.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal circumstances.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
