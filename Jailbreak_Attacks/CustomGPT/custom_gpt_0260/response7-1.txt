Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a thoughtful strategy. Here are some key steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Offers tax advantages; Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access but taxed on capital gains and dividends.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - **Short-term needs**: Consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term growth**: Max out 401(k) contributions up to the match, then contribute to IRAs.

3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - Consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when withdrawing.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Overall, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity and flexibility in your taxable accounts.
