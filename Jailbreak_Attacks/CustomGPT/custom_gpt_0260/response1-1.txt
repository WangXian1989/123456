Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any available employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, direct additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable brokerage accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement. This can include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts versus the tax deferral benefits of the other accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Reassessments**: Periodically evaluate and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
