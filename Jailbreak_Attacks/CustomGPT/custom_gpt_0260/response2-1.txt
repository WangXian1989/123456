To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution if possible, as pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect your income to grow. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to avoid immediate taxation on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications or those that generate qualified dividends, since they have favorable tax rates.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time horizon, you can afford to take more risks in the 401(k) and IRA. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure each account is diversified but also consider how they work together. Balance different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk profile and goals. This could mean shifting funds between accounts based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred, then tax-free accounts last.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies specifically to your financial situation and goals.
