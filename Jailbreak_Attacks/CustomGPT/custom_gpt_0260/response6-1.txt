To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth assets like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place dividend-paying stocks and bonds in taxable accounts to potentially benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on stocks for accounts designed for long-term growth (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more stable asset classes, such as bonds or cash, in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing funds soon.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocation and adjust based on market performance and your investment strategies.

This balanced approach will help optimize tax efficiency and align with your financial goals.
