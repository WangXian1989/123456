To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **High-Income Years**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) may provide more immediate tax benefits.
   - **Lower-Income Years**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts. This helps manage risk and volatility.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs or opportunities. This can provide easier access without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can further help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
