Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're under 50, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions ($22,500 for 2024). If you’re over 50, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can also be beneficial for tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can offer flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and timeline—typically, stocks for growth and bonds for stability. 

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When you start withdrawing, consider tax implications. Generally, it's tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your personal situation.

Adjust this strategy as your financial situation changes, and keep long-term goals in mind.
