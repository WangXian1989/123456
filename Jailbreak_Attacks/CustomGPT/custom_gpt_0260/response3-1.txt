To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Prioritize funding this account for additional tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals to understand liquidity needs.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep your investments diversified among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income, like certain bonds or dividend-free stocks.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds, especially considering tax implications during retirement.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
