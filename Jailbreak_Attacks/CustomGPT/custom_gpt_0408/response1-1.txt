Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers pre-tax contributions (if eligible), with tax-deferred growth until retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages on contributions, but you have flexibility with withdrawals. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressively investing in retirement accounts. A rule of thumb is to have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses set aside.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - For growth, consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since you won't be paying taxes on the gains annually. 
   - More conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**: Your age and how close you are to retirement can influence your approach. Younger individuals might benefit from higher contributions to growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement should prioritize asset preservation.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and changing priorities, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's financial situation is unique, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Consider all these factors and tailor your contributions to align with your overall financial strategy.
