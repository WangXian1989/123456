(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. The tax deferral can significantly enhance your savings.
   
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Each has different benefits and limitations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed favorably if held long term. 

Maintain a balance based on expected withdrawal needs, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor would also be beneficial for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)** first: If your employer matches, itâ€™s like getting free cashâ€”grab that! Max it out as much as possible because those tax benefits are your best friend.

2. **IRA Time**: If you're feeling fancy, split between a traditional and a Roth IRAâ€”both have their perks. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth might be the way to roll. 

3. **Taxable Accounts** are like your wild card. Use them for extra cash that you can easily access or for investments that are tax-efficient. Plus, when you sell those puppies after a year, you get to enjoy the lower capital gains tax.

Ultimately, shake it up based on your age, retirement timeline, and risk appetite. And hey, donâ€™t hesitate to hit up a financial advisor to tailor things just for youâ€”better safe than sorry when it comes to your hard-earned cash!
