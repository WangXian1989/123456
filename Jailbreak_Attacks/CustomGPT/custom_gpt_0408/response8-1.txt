Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for withdrawals. Here are some considerations to help guide your decision:

1. **Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold for a profit and may also generate dividends that are taxable in the year received.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

4. **Investment Options**: Consider the investment options available to you in each type of account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you will need to access funds. Taxable accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals, while retirement accounts have rules (and potential penalties) about accessing funds before retirement age.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals and investment horizon. For instance, if you're early in your career with many years until retirement, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts with growth potential may be beneficial.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to balance risk and return effectively.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust as needed based on changing circumstances and goals.

In summary, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to a 401(k) to receive any employer match, then contribute to an IRA for tax-advantaged growth, and finally allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility. However, your specific situation may dictate a different approach. Consulting with a financial advisor to customize a strategy for your needs can be helpful.
