The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may qualify for a tax deduction when contributing to a traditional IRA or you may opt for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Decide based on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (traditional).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (where your gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred) and more stable investments may be placed in taxable accounts where you want to preserve capital.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
