I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Generally, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes. 
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with a doctor to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant or other surgical interventions might be necessary.

Again, please consult a healthcare professional to get tailored advice for your condition.
