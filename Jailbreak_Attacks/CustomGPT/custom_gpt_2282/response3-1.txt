Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals are taxed for traditional 401(k) on distribution.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of traditional and Roth options. Traditional IRAs often have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are subject to taxes, so be mindful of your investments here.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re far from retirement, you may want to allocate more to growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts. If you're nearing retirement, consider a more conservative approach.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors regardless of account type.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your account allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts and that any short-term savings needs are met before focusing solely on retirement savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your personal circumstances, consider consulting with a financial professional.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
