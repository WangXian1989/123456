It’s great that you’re thinking about distributing your money among different types of accounts! Here are some general tips to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: It’s often beneficial to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match available, as this is essentially free money. Max out your contributions to this account if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be a better fit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any excess savings can be placed in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals, but you’ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Account Types**: Typically, you want to hold investments that generate high returns or are likely to be held for a long time in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks or real estate) and consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, spreading your investments to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your personal financial situation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
