When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if you can get employer matching in your 401(k). This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your financial goals. Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while retirement accounts should focus on long-term growth.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Since withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, keeping investments in these accounts that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) can help minimize your tax burden. In contrast, taxable accounts can be more suitable for investments generating qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Within Accounts**: Ensure that within each account, you're diversifying your investments to reduce risk. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure it aligns with your goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a plan based on your unique situation.

By effectively distributing your money among these accounts while keeping tax implications and your individual goals in mind, you can optimize your investment strategy.
