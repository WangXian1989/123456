To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Max out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA accounts each year, as these accounts provide tax benefits:
   - For a 401(k), the annual contribution limit is typically higher than for IRAs.
   - For IRAs, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy.

3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) might be beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, traditional accounts (like Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) may be more advantageous.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure that you have a solid emergency fund separate from retirement accounts. For goals within the next 3-5 years, using taxable accounts might be wiser since accessing funds is more straightforward without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review Contributions Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s important to reevaluate and adjust your contributions to each account regularly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor, especially regarding complex tax situations or investment strategies.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to investing your money across these accounts while maximizing tax efficiency and preparing for retirement.
