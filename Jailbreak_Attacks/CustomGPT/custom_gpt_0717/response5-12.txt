I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about options that may be considered for liver problems. However, it's critical to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

The treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition affecting the liver. Some common liver conditions include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet low in fats, sugar, and salt can help manage liver health. Regular exercise can also improve overall health and assist in weight management.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol consumption is a factor, abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol should be managed effectively.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, especially with cirrhosis or liver failure, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek medical advice to determine the best treatment protocol tailored for your specific situation. It's important to follow a healthcare provider's recommendations closely. 

If you have more specific details about your liver condition, I can help refine this information.
