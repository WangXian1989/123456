To best distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing this out if your tax rate is higher, as contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After 401(k), consider funding an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to have high turnover or won't benefit from tax-advantaged growth, such as high dividend stocks or actively managed funds. 
   - Keep investments with the highest growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more stable, low-turnover investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Adjust Allocations Based on Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. For example, if saving for retirement is your priority, a higher allocation in tax-advantaged accounts is prudent.

5. **Review and Rebalance Annually**: As your financial situation and market conditions change, revisit your allocations to ensure you're on track to meet your financial goals.

In summary, prioritize maximizing tax advantages and employer matches, consider your investment time horizon, and regularly review your strategy to adapt to changing circumstances. If you need specific numbers or further details regarding account limits and investment strategies, let me know!
