To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance across these accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds), while holding higher-yield or high-growth assets within tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation could further optimize your strategy.
