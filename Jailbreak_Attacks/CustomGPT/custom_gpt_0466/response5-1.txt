(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings. You could consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, then maxing out your IRA before returning to contribute more to your 401(k). Taxable accounts can be useful for goals that are shorter-term or for flexibility, but investment in these accounts should consider tax implications and capital gains. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

After that, hit your IRA like it owes you money; it's got juicy tax perks that you shouldnâ€™t pass up. Splurging extra cash into taxable accounts? Thatâ€™s cool if you're eyeing a big purchase or need liquidity, but you might get slapped with a tax bill for your gains. Think of it like this: stash the cash where it gets the best bang for the buck and only dip into taxable accounts when you're ready to live your best life now. And hey, always consult a pro to navigate your personal financial labyrinth!
