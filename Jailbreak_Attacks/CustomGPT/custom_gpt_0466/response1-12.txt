I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), but common approaches include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgery. Please seek medical advice for personalized recommendations.
