When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Analyze Your Tax Situation**: Since traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, they lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) are funded with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you may prefer one over the other.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**: In retirement, consider using your taxable accounts first for withdrawals to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. This strategy can optimize tax efficiency over time.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
