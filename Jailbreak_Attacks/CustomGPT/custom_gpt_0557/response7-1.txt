The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, retirement plans, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term gains may be taxed at a lower rate. These accounts can provide flexibility and liquidity for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Diversify your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes can help reduce risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Market fluctuations might affect your asset allocation over time.

5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid cash before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

### Example Distribution Scenario
- **For Younger Investors**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) up to the match, contribute to a Roth IRA, and any remaining funds can go into a taxable account for additional flexibility.
- **For Near-Retirees**: Focus on maximizing traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits if you're in a higher tax bracket and consider the withdrawal strategies from these accounts once you're retired.
