To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Utilize Your 401(k) for Higher Contribution Limits**: The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than IRAs. Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you're over 50, which allows for catch-up contributions.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are typically more flexible but can be taxed on capital gains. Balance your investments between tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts to manage your tax liability.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance As Needed**: Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When approaching retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k)), and lastly tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

8. **Consider Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
