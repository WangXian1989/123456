When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, since they offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. 

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - *401(k)*: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - *IRA*: Traditional IRAs offer tax deferment, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - *Taxable Accounts*: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, making them less tax-efficient for long-term investments.

5. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Goals**: If you plan to withdraw funds in the short-term, a taxable account may be more appropriate. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your distribution based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, higher risk is acceptable in tax-advantaged accounts while more stable investments might be preferred in taxable accounts.

7. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes within each account type to balance risk and returns.

An effective approach could be to contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account. 

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals is also beneficial.
