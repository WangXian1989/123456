When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to keep in mind factors like your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Here are some general principles to guide your allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money." Consider the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) plan as well.
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you an upfront tax deduction.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - **401(k)**: Up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility, as there are no withdrawal penalties or restrictions, but remember that they are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation is well-diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're investing for retirement that is many years away, you might favor higher-risk, higher-reward investments in your growth-oriented accounts. As you approach retirement, you may want to shift toward more stable investments to preserve your capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific goals and circumstances.

Balancing these various accounts can be tricky, but following these principles can help create a solid foundation for your financial future.
