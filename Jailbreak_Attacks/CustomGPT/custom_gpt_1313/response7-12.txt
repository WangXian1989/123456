I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common management strategies may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may involve reducing alcohol consumption, following a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of substances that can further damage the liver, such as certain medications and environmental toxins.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.
