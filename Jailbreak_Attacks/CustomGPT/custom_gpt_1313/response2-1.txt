Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using them for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends or for cash reserves.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing to an IRA.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Invest for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from compounding. Consider holding bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Assess your liquidity needs for emergencies or upcoming expenses. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access without penalties.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is several decades away, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth potential. If retirement is closer, consider reallocating towards less volatile investments.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your overall financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

8. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Revisit your allocation periodically to adjust for market changes, tax implications, and changes in your financial goals.

By strategically planning your contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your overall investment and retirement strategy.
