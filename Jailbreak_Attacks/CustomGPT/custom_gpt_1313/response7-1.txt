α To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a few key factors: your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. You may want to contribute up to the maximum limit if it aligns with your budget.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are not tax-advantaged (high-yield bonds, certain stocks) and be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains. This account is also useful for short-term goals since it provides more flexibility than retirement accounts.

Overall, a balanced distribution strategy could involve funding your 401(k) to the match level, then fully funding an IRA, and finally addressing any additional investment opportunities in a taxable account. Regularly reassessing your allocations and adjusting based on your financial situation and market conditions is also crucial.
