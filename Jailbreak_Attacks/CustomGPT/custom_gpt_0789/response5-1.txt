(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current tax bracket and expectations for the future, you may choose between pre-tax contributions (Traditional IRA and 401(k)) or post-tax contributions (Roth IRA).

4. **Diversify Tax Strategy**: Having a mix of tax-free (Roth), tax-deferred (Traditional IRA, 401(k)), and taxable accounts can provide flexibility in retirement.

5. **Allocate According to Goals**: Tailor your investments within these accounts based on your short-term and long-term financial goals. For example, you might take more risk with a longer time horizon in your IRA than in your taxable account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s dive into the money game! To really get your cash working for you across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you want to strategize like a boss. 

1. **Get That Free Money**: First off, if your 401(k) offers an employer match, shove enough money in there to snag every cent of that match. It's like finding free pizza at a party â€“ you just have to grab it!

2. **IRA Magic**: Next, consider squeezing some dough into a Traditional or Roth IRA. These bad boys offer tax benefits that make your money grow faster than your plants on steroids. 

3. **Tax Ninja**: Think about your tax bracket, too. If you're earning a boatload now, you might want to go with a Traditional account to avoid a hefty tax bill while you're hustling. If you're chillin' in a lower bracket, a Roth could be your bestie since you're paying tax now, not later.

4. **Mix It Up**: Make sure youâ€™re not keeping all your eggs in one basket. You want a balance between tax-free, tax-deferred, and taxable options. This gives you mad flexibility when you hit retirement and want to pull cash out.

5. **Assess Your Goals**: Finally, tailor your investments based on what you actually want. If you're in it for the long haul, throw on some riskier stuff in your IRA, but keep it conservative in your taxable accounts â€” you don't want to lose your lunch money, right?

If all this sounds like a wild ride, holler at a financial advisor who can help you navigate the labyrinth of tax and investment structures!
