When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it is essentially free money. If your plan allows, consider increasing contributions over time.
   - **IRA**: Traditional or Roth IRA contributions can provide tax advantages. Prioritize maxing out your contributions if you're eligible (as of 2023, the maximum contribution is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth accounts (IRA and 401(k)) are funded with after-tax dollars, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts may be more suitable for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains.

4. **Account Priorities**:
   - As a general rule, itâ€™s often best to focus on tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts. This order helps maximize tax savings and growth potential.
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use any additional funds for investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment opportunities change.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given that everyone's financial situation is unique, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
