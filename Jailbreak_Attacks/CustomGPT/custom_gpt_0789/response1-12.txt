I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage specific liver conditions, or in severe cases, procedures like liver transplants. Depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), the approach can vary significantly. Always best to check with a healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your situation!
