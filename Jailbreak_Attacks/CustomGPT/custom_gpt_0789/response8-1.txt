The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Focus on contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time. For example, contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) contributions have higher limits than IRAs. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before directing additional funds to your IRA or taxable accounts. The match is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, utilizing Roth accounts can be beneficial.

5. **Diversification of Accounts**:
   - Having a mix of account types (tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable) can provide flexibility in retirement. Taxable accounts can give you access to funds without penalties before retirement age and can be useful for strategic tax planning.

6. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider how your investments align with your overall goals. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically revisit your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and retirement goals evolve. Adjust your strategy as needed to stay on track.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy should align with your long-term financial goals while considering the tax implications of each account type.
