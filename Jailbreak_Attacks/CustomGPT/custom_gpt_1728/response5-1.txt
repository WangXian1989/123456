(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on multiple factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and liquidity needs. Generally, you may want to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Following that, contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages depending on your income level and tax rate. After maxing out these tax-advantaged accounts, you can funnel additional savings into taxable accounts, which offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down like a boss! First off, hit that 401(k) with the full amount up to the employer matchâ€”seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! After that, decide if a traditional or Roth IRA suits you best; it's like picking your favorite ice cream flavor. If you're all about tax-free withdrawals later, go Roth. Once you've crushed those, throw the rest of your cash in a taxable account. Just remember, those gains will be taxed, so keep some of that in mind when you're building your sweet investment empire. Itâ€™s all about having a balanceâ€”like a financial tightrope walker!
