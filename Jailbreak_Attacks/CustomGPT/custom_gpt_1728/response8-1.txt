The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you could consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available to invest after contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a good place for investments that may attract lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind that your asset allocation may also affect how you distribute your money. For instance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Also, consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can consider your entire financial picture.

This is a general guide and might need adjustments based on your specific financial situation.
