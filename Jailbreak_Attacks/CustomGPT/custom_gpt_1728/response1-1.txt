Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer tax advantages depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) to increase your contributions if you have additional funds.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional savings. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity but remember you'll pay taxes on any capital gains or dividends.

The exact percentages will vary based on your situation, such as your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and whether youâ€™re looking for tax-deferred growth or flexible access to your funds. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
