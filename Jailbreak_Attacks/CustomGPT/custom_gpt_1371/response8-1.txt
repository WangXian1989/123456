The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. You’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it can provide tax deductions upfront. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but earnings and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalty. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to maintain a diversified portfolio within each type of account. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**: Consider your time horizon. Funds in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) should typically be for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be used for more immediate financial needs or goals.

6. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**: Make regular contributions to each account as your financial situation allows and periodically rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial objectives.
