Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and a suggested approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider when you plan to access these funds (e.g., retirement, purchasing a home, etc.).

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means you lower your taxable income today but pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, which can be less favorable if you hold investments for a short period.

### 3. **Diversified Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

### 4. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
   - **First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Second**: Max out your IRA contributions if income limits allow. 
   - **Third**: Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable investment accounts.

By thoughtfully distributing your investments across these accounts, you can balance growth, risk, and tax efficiency while working towards your financial objectives.
