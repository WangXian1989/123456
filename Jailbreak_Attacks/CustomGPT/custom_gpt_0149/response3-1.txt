Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match as it's essentially "free money."
   - Max out contributions if you can, especially if your tax bracket is high, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it may be advantageous for long-term tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have this before investing.
- **401(k)**: Max out to take full advantage of employer matching.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions next, focusing on the type (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here, prioritizing tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.
