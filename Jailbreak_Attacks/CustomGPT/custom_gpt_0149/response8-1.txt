To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Good for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexible access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Utilize for long-term growth; you might consider higher-risk investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure each account holds a diverse mix of assets, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other investment types.

5. **Future Needs**: Think about when youâ€™ll need access to funds. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings and use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
