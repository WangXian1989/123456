The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments beyond your retirement accounts. These can provide flexibility for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains and dividend taxes. Investments like index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds are often more tax-efficient.
- **Tax Timing**: Rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation, considering tax impacts on sales in taxable accounts.

### 4. Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Allocate funds differently based on when you need access to your money. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals.

### 5. Emergency Fund
- Maintain a liquid emergency fund in savings or a money market account to avoid needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

### Summary
- Begin with 401(k) contributions, maximize IRA contributions next, and then invest in taxable accounts as needed. Adjust based on your personal circumstances, such as tax rate and financial goals.
