When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or Roth IRAs, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider allocating more to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) to lower your taxable income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of investments across accounts. For example, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, and bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Emergency Funds**: Maintain a separate fund in a high-yield savings account or money market fund to cover unexpected expenses, keeping your investment accounts intact.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, strategize how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account to minimize taxes and maximize longevity of your savings.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
