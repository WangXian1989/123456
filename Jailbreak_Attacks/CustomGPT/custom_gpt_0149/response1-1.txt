Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions based on eligibility.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year earned. Use these for more liquid investments or short-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-term**: Retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) can hold higher-risk investments since you won't need the funds for many years.
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for more accessible money and conservative investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
