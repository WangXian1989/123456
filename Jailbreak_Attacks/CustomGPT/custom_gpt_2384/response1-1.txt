Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly enhance your investments over time. If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Since traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred, you usually want to prioritize these accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, consider supplementing with a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Assess Your Cash Flow Needs**: Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. It’s crucial to ensure you’re not forced to withdraw from your retirement accounts prematurely, which could incur penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk. Consider the overall asset allocation in your investment strategy and how it aligns with your financial goals.

5. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy in light of changing life circumstances (e.g., marriage, children, job changes) and market conditions. Adjust your allocations as needed to reflect your evolving risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best approach, seeking advice from a financial professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

Always remember that investing involves risks, and it’s essential to do thorough research or consult with a financial expert before making significant decisions regarding your investments.
