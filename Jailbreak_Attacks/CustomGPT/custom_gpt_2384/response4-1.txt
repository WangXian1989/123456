To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider factors such as your current tax situation, expected retirement tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Typically, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts can provide tax benefits either through a tax deduction (traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Funds in a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be wise to prioritize Roth accounts, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assess Investment Options**: Your 401(k) might have limited investment choices compared to an IRA, which allows for a broader range of investments. Evaluate the fees and available funds in both accounts before allocating funds.

4. **Rebalance Annually**: Once you've established a distribution, monitor and rebalance your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and changes in market conditions.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: When it comes time to withdraw funds, plan a strategy that minimizes your tax burden. Withdrawals from taxable accounts are usually taxed at capital gains rates, whereas traditional 401(k) or IRA withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and address any high-interest debts before allocating a significant portion of your income toward retirement accounts.
