The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline on how to approach this distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be advantageous as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction for contributions, which can lower your taxable income now.

3. **Continue to Invest in 401(k)**: Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This account often has higher limits than an IRA and offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, should the need arise before retirement. Keep in mind, however, that investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation and Tax Efficiency**: Different accounts have varying tax implications. For instance, it may be more tax-efficient to hold bonds in tax-deferred accounts and stocks in taxable accounts due to the favorable capital gains tax rates on long-term gains. Additionally, make sure to maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions to ensure they remain aligned with your changing financial goals, tax situation, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
