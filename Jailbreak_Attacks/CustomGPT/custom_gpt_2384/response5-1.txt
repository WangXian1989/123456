(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally speaking, you should consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: Depending on your tax bracket, contributing to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your current income is lower than it might be in the future, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for added flexibility and access to funds before retirement without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes and consider your risk tolerance when allocating funds among these accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable to create a personalized strategy.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down in a straightforward way! Hereâ€™s how you can sprinkle your cash around like a pro:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer is matching your contributions, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab that free money. Itâ€™s like finding cash on the sidewalk!

2. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose wisely! If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, you might wanna pump some money into a Roth IRA. Itâ€™s like paying your taxes now instead of when youâ€™re living it up in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts = Freedom**: Once that 401(k) and IRA are maxed, get some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re way more flexible. Need to buy a yacht before retirement? You can pull from this!

4. **Spread the Love (aka Diversification)**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Mix things up so youâ€™re not crying in your cocktail when a market dip happens.
