Iâ€™m not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes like improved diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms and underlying conditions, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries depending on the severity of the issue. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans tailored to your specific situation. They can run appropriate tests, assess your liver function, and determine the best course of action for you. Please take care of your health!
