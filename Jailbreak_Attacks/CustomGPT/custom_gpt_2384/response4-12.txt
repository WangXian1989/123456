I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that people with liver problems typically consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver issues might include lifestyle changes such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol. Medications or procedures could also be options, depending on the specific condition. It's crucial to receive a proper diagnosis and follow the treatment plan prescribed by a qualified professional.
