The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out contributions here next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates. This can include stocks or ETFs.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Think about when youâ€™ll need access to funds. Taxable accounts are better for short-term goals since you can access them without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
