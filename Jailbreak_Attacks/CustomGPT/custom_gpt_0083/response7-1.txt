To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In each account, ensure a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations in response to changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

### Key Tips:
- Evaluate your tax situation to decide between traditional versus Roth accounts.
- Consider your investment timeline; longer timelines may favor more aggressive investments.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This balanced approach will help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
