The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k), especially with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. These are suitable for short- to medium-term goals as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals. While you won’t have the same tax advantages, you can benefit from capital gains and interest.

### Recommended Order:
1. Max out employer match on 401(k)
2. Contribute to IRA (up to the limit)
3. Increase contributions to 401(k) up to max allowable
4. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
