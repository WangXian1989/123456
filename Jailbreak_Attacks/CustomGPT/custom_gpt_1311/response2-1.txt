To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. After maximizing any employer match, consider the following order:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit, then consider increasing contributions if you have more to invest.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This allows for tax-free growth or tax-deferred contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Different accounts may offer various investment options, fees, and growth potential. You might opt for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term horizon and tax deferment, while using more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Balance Risk and Taxes**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to lower capital gains taxes. Bonds or high yield assets might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Revisit your allocation periodically based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals. Adjust contributions and investments accordingly.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy according to your specific needs, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts effectively.
