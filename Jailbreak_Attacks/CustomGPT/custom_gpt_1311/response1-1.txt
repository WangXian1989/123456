Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match — it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next, as they offer tax advantages and flexibility for retirement savings.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: Once you’ve taken advantage of the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you can max out contributions while keeping an eye on fees associated with the plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful if you plan to access funds before retirement or want to diversify your investments.

5. **Invest Wisely**: In all accounts, focus on a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
