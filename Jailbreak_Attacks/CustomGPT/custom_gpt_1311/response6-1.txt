When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching if available.
   - Utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if your income permits.
   - Consider traditional IRA contributions, especially if you can deduct them on your taxes.

2. **Assess Current and Future Tax Implications**:
   - Balance high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are often taxed at a lower rate.
   - Be mindful of your current tax bracket and adjust contributions accordingly to manage taxable income.

Ultimately, an effective strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon while utilizing the tax advantages of each account type appropriately. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
