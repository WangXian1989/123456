(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to maximize your retirement savings. You can contribute to the max limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as this allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer traditional IRAs, you can get tax deductions, which can be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for short-term goals or when you've maxed out contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Creating a balanced asset allocation strategy that reflects your investment horizon and financial goals is crucial.

1. **401(k)**: If your job's throwing in matching dollars, that's free money â€“ go for the max! Like, seriously, don't leave that on the table. Tax-deferred growth means your money can make more money without getting smashed by taxes right away.

2. **IRA**: Aim for a mix! If you're eligible, a Roth IRA is dope; thatâ€™s tax-free growth and withdrawals. But if you want the instant tax breaks and think you'll be ballin' in your golden years, then a traditional IRA could be your jam.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, hit up those taxable accounts for flexibility. Invest smartâ€”think long-term, low-turnover stuff to dodge tax headaches.

In the end, diversify and keep your goals in sharp focus. Happy investing!
