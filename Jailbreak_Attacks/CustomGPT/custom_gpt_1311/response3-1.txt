Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) regarding tax treatment, but with potential income eligibility limits for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling and interest/dividends may be taxed annually.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to minimize risks and enhance potential returns.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors typically can afford to take more risks with their investments, while older investors may want to prioritize stability. 

6. **Consider Retirement Timeline**: The closer you get to retirement, the more you might want to shift your assets into less volatile investments to protect your principal.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
