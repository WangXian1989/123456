I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your specific liver condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, procedures like surgery or liver transplantation. Always seek professional guidance for any health concerns.
