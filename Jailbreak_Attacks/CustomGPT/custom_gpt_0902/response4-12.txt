I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: Some people explore supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best treatment plan tailored to your condition.
