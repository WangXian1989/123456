To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Many employers offer matching contributions; take full advantage of this.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t offer immediate tax benefits, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, beneficial for shorter-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If saving for retirement, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, taking advantage of the compound growth over time.
   - Consider your timeline: Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term growth can focus on retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Balance your investments across these accounts to diversify? This means holding a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each, taking into account the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits: For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer, delaying taxes on 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, especially regarding tax implications.

A common approach is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k), fully fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, and then invest additional savings in taxable accounts for flexibility. Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy as financial needs and tax laws change.
