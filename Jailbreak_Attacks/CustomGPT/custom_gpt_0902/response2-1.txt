Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that match first. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. The choice between a Traditional or Roth IRA depends on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). They offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is valuable if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year qualifies for long-term capital gains rates, which are lower than ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**  
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies before focusing entirely on retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Choices**  
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts. Consider equity, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Review Regularly**  
   - **Rebalance** your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**  
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation, helping you navigate complex tax implications and investment choices.

### Example Distribution Strategy:  
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to the match).
- **IRA**: $6,500 annually (or the maximum allowed).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings after the above contributions.

This is a basic framework; individual circumstances may vary, so tailor these suggestions to fit your specific financial goals and needs.
