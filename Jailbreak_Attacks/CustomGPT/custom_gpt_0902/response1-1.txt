Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Offers more investment flexibility than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Standard investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term goals (0-5 years)**: Use taxable accounts for accessibility to funds and flexibility.
   - **Medium to long-term goals (5+ years)**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)** first, especially if there’s an employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max out your IRA** if eligible, choosing between traditional and Roth based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for additional investments if you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place **bonds and high-yield investments** in tax-advantaged accounts to shield tax from interest.
   - Keep **stocks with high growth potential** in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 6. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

### Example Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions annually.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest extra funds, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion
Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs. They can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances and help navigate any complexities in your investment strategy.
