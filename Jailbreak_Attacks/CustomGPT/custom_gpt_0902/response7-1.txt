To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often the best place to start, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts may be better suited for investments that produce lower capital gains or qualify for favorable tax treatment, like long-term investments. Use them for investments that are likely to produce income (like dividends) that can be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review your portfolio in all accounts to ensure your asset allocation reflects your overall financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - Your age and when you plan to retire should guide your allocation. Younger investors can generally afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stability.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid withdrawing from your retirement plans unexpectedly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to discuss your unique financial situation with a professional who can provide tailored advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your retirement goals.
