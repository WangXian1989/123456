Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.
   - **401(k)**: After achieving the employer match, continue to contribute to your 401(k). Consider the tax implications depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth 401(k).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for funds needed in the short term.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following this strategy, you can optimize your savings and investments over time to meet your financial goals.
