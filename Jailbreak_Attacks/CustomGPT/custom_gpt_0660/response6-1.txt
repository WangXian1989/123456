Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
  
### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Review your tax bracket to determine how much to contribute.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions like 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs have post-tax contributions but tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals or funds you'll need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on your employer's plan options. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use a broader range of investment options, including ETFs, stocks, and mutual funds for more tailored diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize annual tax implications.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance Considerations**
   - Adjust your allocations based on your age and how close you are to retirement. Generally, a younger investor can afford more risk in stocks, while someone nearing retirement may shift toward bonds and stable investments.

### 5. **Emergency Fund Maintenance**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a cash or low-risk account before heavily investing.

### Quick Summary:
- Max out 401(k) employer match.
- Assess your tax situation and adjust contributions accordingly.
- Diversify investments across each account type based on your goals and risk tolerance.
