(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth. Choose the type based on your income and whether you prefer tax benefits upfront or in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful if you need liquidity or want to invest in assets that don't fit well into retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) can help minimize your tax burden in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! If you're looking to allocate your dough among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here’s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: Seriously, max out that company match! If your employer’s tossing in extra cash, grab that before anything else. It’s like finding free money in your sock drawer!

2. **IRA Time**: After that good stuff, hit up your IRA. Depending on your income level, get a Roth for tax-free gains or a Traditional for a nice tax deduction. It’s all about that retirement glow-up!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've topped off those tax-advantaged accounts, it’s time to dive into taxable accounts. Think of it as your investment buffet – you have flexibility and can pull from it whenever you need (just don’t plan on a “tax-free” feast here).

4. **Mind Those Taxes**: Don’t be a tax rookie! Keep an eye on what you’re investing in. Go for tax-efficient investments like index funds to keep your taxable accounts from becoming a tax nightmare.

5. **Diversify, Baby**: Spread that cash around! You don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket, right? Mix it up across all accounts to balance risk and keep things smooth.

And hey, if you’re clueless, a financial advisor can work wonders! Just make sure you’re making your money work for you, not the other way around!
