The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement under certain conditions. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not provide tax benefits like the retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in withdrawal without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals**: Determine your investment time horizon. If you're investing for long-term goals like retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you need liquidity in the near term, focus more on taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your unique circumstances.

Always consider both current and future financial conditions, and adjust your allocations as needed over time.
