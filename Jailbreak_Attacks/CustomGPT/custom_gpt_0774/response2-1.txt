When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take advantage of this free money. This is often the best immediate return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as these can provide tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for a traditional or Roth IRA (plus a $1,000 catch-up if eligible).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age and can also provide capital gains and dividend income.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: The way you distribute your money should also reflect your investment goals:
   - For long-term growth (like retirement), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For medium-term goals (like buying a house), a mix of taxable accounts may be appropriate.
   
6. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Periodic Review**: Revisit your distribution strategy regularly, especially as tax laws, rules around account contributions, and your personal financial situation change.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor the distribution to your specific circumstances and objectives.
