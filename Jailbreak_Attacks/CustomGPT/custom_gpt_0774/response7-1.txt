When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributions to these accounts can lower your taxable income. Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, youâ€™ll also have varying tax implications when you withdraw the money in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. This ensures you have liquid funds available for unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Liabilities**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are subject to income tax, while Roth IRA withdrawals are typically tax-free in retirement. This can influence where to draw funds from first in retirement.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or where you need liquidity, but remember that dividends and capital gains can increase your tax burden.

7. **Keep an Eye on Fees**: Be aware of any fees associated with your investment accounts. Lower fees can lead to higher overall returns in the long run.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals. Adjust contributions accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
