To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed in the year realized, usually at a lower capital gains tax rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term vs. long-term goals; this will heavily influence where to place different assets.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to employer matching in your 401(k) first.

### Strategic Distribution Suggestions:

- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Always utilize any available employer match to optimize contributions.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If eligible, utilizing a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth for future withdrawals.
- **Diversify taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access early or for tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds.
- **Reassess regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in tax laws, investment goals, or financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
