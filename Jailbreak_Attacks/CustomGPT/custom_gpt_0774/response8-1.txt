To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Contributions here reduce your taxable income (traditional accounts) or offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth accounts).
   - **Taxable accounts**: These are best for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider the types of assets you hold and how they align with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, your withdrawal sequence might prioritize accounts to minimize taxes, often starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
