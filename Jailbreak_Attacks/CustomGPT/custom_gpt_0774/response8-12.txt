I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight. Depending on the specific liver condition, medications or procedures may also be necessary. Please make sure to seek medical guidance for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
