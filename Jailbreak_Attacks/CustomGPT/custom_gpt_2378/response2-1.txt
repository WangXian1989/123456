Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Benefit**: This is essentially "free money" and a good starting point.

### 2. **Fund Your IRA**
   - **Type**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial for you based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Goal**: After maximizing the IRA, focus on contributing the maximum allowable to your 401(k).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (if Traditional) and grow tax-deferred.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - **When to Use**: If you have maxed out retirement accounts and have extra funds, consider taxable accounts.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Make sure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review your asset distribution and performance.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Modify your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If needed, a financial expert can help customize your strategy based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced portfolio that leverages the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while maximizing your overall investment potential.
