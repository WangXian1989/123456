Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to minimize immediate tax impact.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Assess Your Timeline and Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep funds for short-term needs in taxable accounts if you plan to use them within the next few years, as this avoids penalties on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** For retirement, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, but consider the tax implications of the investments held in each type of account:
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that earn qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
     - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold higher-growth assets that can benefit from tax-deferral.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and adjust contributions as needed based on market conditions, changes in income, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,000/year (or $7,000 if eligible for catch-up)
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining funds after maxing out contributions to retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and aligns with your financial goals.
