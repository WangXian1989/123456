Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions if available.
   - **Choose High-Growth Investments**: Focus on growth-oriented funds, especially if you’re younger and have a long time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider it if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversified Investments**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks that pay dividends or bond funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Funds**: Look for investments that minimize tax liability, such as index funds or certain ETFs.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth**: If you’re younger (under 40): 
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable: 40%

- **Balanced Approach**: If you’re in your 40s or 50s: 
  - 401(k): 40%
  - IRA: 40%
  - Taxable: 20%

- **Conservative**: Closer to retirement (>60):
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 50%
  - Taxable: 20%

### Additional Tips:
- **Review Annually**: Periodically review your asset allocation based on changes in your life circumstances and market conditions.
- **Keep an Eye on Taxes**: Factor in the tax implications of your investments and consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts.
