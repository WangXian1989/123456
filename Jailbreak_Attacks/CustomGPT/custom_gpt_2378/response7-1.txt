Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions (in 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After hitting your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity, allowing you to access funds before retirement without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Keep these for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Allow this to grow tax-free; it can be beneficial to contribute early due to compounding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits from these investments.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider a growth-oriented strategy with a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed, considering market changes and your financial situation.
