Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations to help you decide:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually, and capital gains are taxed when you sell investments.

### 2. **Retirement Goals**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA) for long-term growth to maximize tax benefits.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for shorter-term goals where flexibility is needed.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maxing out these accounts can significantly enhance your savings.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains or tax-exempt bonds.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and optimize returns.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of retirement accounts for immediate access without penalties.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Always take advantage of any matching contributions.
2. **Contribute to IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, make contributions to maximize tax advantages.
3. **Return to 401(k) to meet limits**: After maxing out IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions.
4. **Invest in taxable accounts**: Use surplus funds for taxable accounts, especially for anytime access.

### Regular Review
Regularly review and adjust your investments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific circumstances, ensuring an optimal distribution strategy.
