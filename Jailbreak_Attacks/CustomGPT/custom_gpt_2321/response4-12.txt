I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver issues. Treatment options for liver problems may vary based on the specific condition, so a thorough evaluation is essential. Typically, management may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgical interventions. Please reach out to a qualified healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your situation.
