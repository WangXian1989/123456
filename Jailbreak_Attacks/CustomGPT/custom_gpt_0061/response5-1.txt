Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a concise strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional) for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on investments that provide tax efficiency (like index funds).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts and be mindful of capital gains. Evaluate the potential tax impact when withdrawing from each type of account during retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
