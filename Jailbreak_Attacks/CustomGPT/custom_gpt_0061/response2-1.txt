When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. It's good for growth without immediate tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in pre-tax contributions; pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax. Withdrawals (including growth) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually. This is good for flexibility but less tax-efficient.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans (like 401(k)) if they offer matching contributions—this is essentially free money.
   - Follow the annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). 
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you're near retirement.

### 4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts provide flexibility for emergencies or short-term needs.
   - 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal before the age of 59½.

### 5. **Asset Location**
   - Place your higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as taxes are lower on long-term capital gains versus ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Max out employer match** in your 401(k).
2. **Contribute to IRAs** (consider Roth for tax-free growth if eligible).
3. **Fund taxable accounts** with any surplus and for short-term goals or liquidity.

### Regular Review
- Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
