Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Maximize contributions to these accounts first. They offer tax benefits either through tax-deferred growth (401(k), traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, a traditional IRA can be beneficial if you’re currently in a higher tax bracket and want to lower your taxable income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes—hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing funds from these accounts that minimizes taxes and maintains your lifestyle.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) up to the employer match.**
- **Max out IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.**
- **Contribute to a taxable account with any remaining funds.**

### Conclusion:
Tailor your distribution strategy based on individual circumstances, and it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
