I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats; avoid fatty, sugary foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Your doctor may prescribe medications to manage specific liver conditions or symptoms, including antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can greatly help in liver recovery.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
   - Conditions like diabetes and obesity should be managed to reduce stress on the liver.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and track any changes.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplants or other surgical interventions may be necessary.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.
