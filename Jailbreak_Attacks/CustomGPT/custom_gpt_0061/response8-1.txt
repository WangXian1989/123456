To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for higher earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to 401(k) regarding tax deferrals. Consider if you have maxed out your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for more flexible withdrawal options and for investing in assets with favorable capital gains treatment.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in your taxable account for liquidity before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden. 

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contribution to benefit from employer match.
- **Roth IRA:** Contribute up to the limit for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest funds that exceed retirement account limits or for shorter-term goals.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions based on tax advantages, employer benefits, and liquidity needs is key. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
