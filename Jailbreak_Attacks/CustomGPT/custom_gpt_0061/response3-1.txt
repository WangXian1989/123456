Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you might sell in the short term.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Typically has a limited selection of funds. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Offers more flexibility. You can invest in a wider range of assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that can be more tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Your Age and Goals:**
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth in their 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards safer investments across all accounts to preserve capital.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Age 25-40:** 50% to 401(k), 30% to IRA, 20% to taxable accounts.
- **Age 40-60:** 40% to 401(k), 40% to IRA, 20% to taxable accounts.
- **Age 60+:** 30% to 401(k), 30% to IRA, 40% to taxable accounts. 

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Conclusion:
Balance contributions based on tax advantages, investment flexibility, and growth potential, while adapting your strategy as your financial situation changes. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a wise choice.
