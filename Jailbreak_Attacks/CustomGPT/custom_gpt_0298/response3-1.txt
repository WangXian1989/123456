Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—it’s free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't reached your employer’s match, prioritize contributions here next.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access to funds, but be aware of capital gains taxes. They’re also suitable for investments with lower tax implications (like index funds).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - High-growth investments (like stocks) often work better in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider keeping tax-efficient assets (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

6. **Review Regularly**: Check your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstance.
