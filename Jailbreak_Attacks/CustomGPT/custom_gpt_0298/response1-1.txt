Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate returns on your investment.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxes.

### Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and consider putting lower-growth or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Additional Tips
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
- **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This approach helps balance growth potential and tax efficiency effectively.
