Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant, especially with a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, especially if you need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. For retirement accounts, focus on long-term growth through stocks. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. Withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts are taxed as income, so strategize your withdrawals to minimize taxes in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on your financial situation and market conditions.
