Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. **Consider Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Maintain a portion here for emergencies or short-term goals, as these accounts provide easy access without penalties.
  
### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Invest Tax-Efficiently:** Place lower-taxed investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth or income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk appetite. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 5. **Future Tax Bracket Consideration:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRAs.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your individual situation can provide personalized insights.
