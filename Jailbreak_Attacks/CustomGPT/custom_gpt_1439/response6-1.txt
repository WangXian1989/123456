To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. This is advantageous for growing your investments without immediate tax liabilities.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends from investments in taxable accounts are subject to taxes in the year they are earned, which can diminish returns if not managed properly.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: If you're investing for long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth potential.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For short-term needs, keep a portion of your funds in taxable accounts for easy access, while considering the potential tax impact of capital gains.

**Strategies for Distribution:**
- **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), based on your income level and tax situation.
- **Fill Up Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

**Allocation Example**:
- **50% in 401(k)**: Utilize employer matches and focus on long-term growth.
- **30% in IRA**: Opt for a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, otherwise Traditional IRA.
- **20% in Taxable Accounts**: Keep this flexible for short-term needs, emergencies, or other investment opportunities.

Adjust these allocations based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline for optimal results. Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor these recommendations to your personal circumstances.
