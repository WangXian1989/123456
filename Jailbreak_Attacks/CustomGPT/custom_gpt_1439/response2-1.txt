When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors to optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. It grows tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not enjoy the same tax advantages but can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Max out employer-matching contributions in your 401(k) first.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Your age and retirement timeline can impact your asset allocation. Generally, longer investment horizons can afford to take on more risk, potentially leading to higher returns.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth assets, while the taxable account can be used for more liquid investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds. Make sure you understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can offer personalized strategies based on your financial goals and circumstances.

A common strategy might be to:
- Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to a Roth IRA if you are eligible (for tax-free growth), and finally invest in a taxable account with any remaining funds. 

Such an allocation may help balance tax benefits, flexibility, and long-term growth potential effectively.
