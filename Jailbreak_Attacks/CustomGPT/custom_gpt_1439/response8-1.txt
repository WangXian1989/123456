The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can help reduce your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments that generate lower tax rates, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. For high-yield investments, it might be better to keep those in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account.

4. **Assess Asset Allocation**: Your investments in each account should align with your desired asset allocation (the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets). While managing your overall risk, consider how different accounts will interact tax-wise.

5. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**: Consistently contribute to your accounts and periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Long-Term Perspective**: Prioritize long-term growth in your tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for shorter-term savings or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By tailoring your distribution strategy based on these principles, you can optimize your investments and tax efficiency.
