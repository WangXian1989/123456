When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment options, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantages Accounts**: After maximizing employer match, consider the tax advantages of your 401(k) and IRA. Both accounts provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw them, typically in retirement. 

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (reducing your taxable income). Look at your investment options, fees, and any employer contributions.
   
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more aligned with your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any money left after your retirement account contributions can be directed towards taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals (like home purchase, travel, or retirement) will influence how aggressively you should invest your money.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow or decline, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Tax Strategy**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from these accounts in the future. Understanding how withdrawals will affect your tax bracket can inform your strategy.

By considering these aspects and perhaps consulting with a financial advisor, you can develop a strategy that optimally allocates your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for your specific financial situation.
