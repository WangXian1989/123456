The best strategy for distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment horizons. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the current year.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you or your spouse is covered by a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider your tax bracket and the length of time you plan to hold investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. Financial advisors often recommend 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses set aside.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: If you're younger and have time until retirement, you might lean towards a heavier allocation in growth-oriented investments. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2023 is $22,500, with a catch-up of $7,500 for those over 50; IRA limit is $6,500/$7,500 for catch-up).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain, seeking advice from a financial planner can help tailor an investment strategy that fits your unique situation.

By evaluating these factors, you can better decide how to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
