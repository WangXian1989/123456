When it comes to distributing your money among different types of retirement accounts, it's essential to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively "free money."
   - Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible, as 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Depending on your income, you might be able to make contributions to both. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings and investments that you might need access to before retirement age, as they do not have withdrawal restrictions.
   - Consider placing investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy:
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread these investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
- **Consider Taxes**: Plan your allocations based on potential tax impacts. For instance, high-growth investments may be better in a tax-advantaged account to avoid capital gains taxes.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and market conditions change, adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It may also be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Remember, these are general guidelinesâ€”not one-size-fits-all solutions. Always factor in your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon when making investment decisions.
