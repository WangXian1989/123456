Organizations can implement systems that require employees to scan their faces upon entering and exiting the workplace. This data can then be logged to track attendance and punctuality. Furthermore, performance monitoring can be enhanced by integrating biometric data with productivity metrics, such as login/logout times or the completion of specific tasks.

However, it's essential to consider privacy concerns and compliance with local laws regarding data protection and employee rights. Transparency with employees about how their data will be used is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring a positive work environment.
