The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize employer match first: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to optimize tax benefits: This account allows for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current vs. future tax rate: If you believe your taxes will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA; if you anticipate lower taxes, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.
   - Max out contributions if possible: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for flexible goals: Taxable accounts offer liquidity and can hold a variety of investments, making them suitable for financial goals with shorter timelines.
   - Invest in tax-efficient vehicles: Consider index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Balance your investments across accounts: Allocate based on the types of accounts. For example, hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Annually:**
   - Reassess and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, goals, tax laws, and investment performance.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
