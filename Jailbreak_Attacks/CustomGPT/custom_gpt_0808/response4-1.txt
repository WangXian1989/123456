To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs differ from Roth IRAs in tax treatment. Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth but are taxed when withdrawn. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale. Interest and dividends are also taxed as income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) first, then contribute to IRAs.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Stocks may be better suited for long-term growth, while bonds may be appropriate for more immediate needs.
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments that benefit from tax deferral or exemption.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about when and how you will need access to funds. 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59Â½), while funds in a taxable account can be accessed without penalty.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to spread risk and optimize returns.

A common recommendation often suggests maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then funding a Roth or Traditional IRA as per your tax situation, followed by any additional investments in a taxable account.
