When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies:

### Allocation Strategies

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Status:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributing to tax-deferred accounts like a Traditional IRA or 401(k).
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider Roth accounts for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Different accounts can hold varied assets based on their tax implications.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile, especially after significant market movements.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Keep some investments in taxable accounts for flexibility, as these can provide quicker access to funds without penalties while allowing for capital gains tax considerations.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor is essential to tailor your strategy to your financial situation and goals. They can help optimize your asset allocation and consider any specific strategies that apply to your case.
