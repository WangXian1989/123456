The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify based on income, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can also be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need before retirement age or for specific goals (like buying a home).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategy:
- **Balance Your Contributions**: Depending on your goals, aim to balance contributions across these accounts to optimize for tax efficiency and growth. 
- **Consider Your Time Horizon**: More aggressive investments might go in a tax-advantaged account, while more stable investments could be in taxable accounts.
- **Review Each Year**: Re-evaluate your allocations annually based on performance, changes in income, and financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Ultimately, personal circumstances vary widely, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor familiar with your situation.
