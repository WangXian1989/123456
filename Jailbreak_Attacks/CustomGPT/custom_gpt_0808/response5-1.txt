(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best distribution of your savings among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, you might consider allocating more into tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, since they offer tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs). 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be better for tax deduction benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access to funds. They can also be good for investments in assets like index funds, which may be more tax-efficient.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The smart move is to load up your 401(k) and IRA firstâ€”they're like your financial shields against Uncle Sam. Max out that 401(k), especially if your employerâ€™s doling out free matches. Free money, dude! 

After that, think about your IRA. If youâ€™re all about that tax-free life in retirement, go for a Roth. But if playing the long game and dodging taxes now is your jam, a traditional IRA works. Finally, the taxable account is like your wild cardâ€”easy access, but watch out for the tax man. Best bet? Index funds or ETFs that wonâ€™t hit you too hard when tax season rolls around.
