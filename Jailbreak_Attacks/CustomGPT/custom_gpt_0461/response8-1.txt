The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Contribute to your tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts. Money in a 401(k) and IRA grows tax-deferred or tax-free, whereas taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensure your investments are diversified among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**: As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds. Taxable accounts may be used first to allow tax-deferred accounts time to grow.

6. **Regularly Review Your Distribution Strategy**: Your financial situation and markets will change over time, so regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help you create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Remember that the appropriate strategy also depends on your individual circumstances, including income, expenses, and financial goals.
