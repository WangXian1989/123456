Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this to ensure you take full advantage of free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, as contributions grow tax-free. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be a better fit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

4. **Balance According to Goals**: Adjust your contributions based on your specific goals (e.g., saving for retirement, a major purchase, etc.) and how soon you plan to access the money.

5. **Review Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type. Growth in tax-advantaged accounts is generally tax-deferred or tax-free, while gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
