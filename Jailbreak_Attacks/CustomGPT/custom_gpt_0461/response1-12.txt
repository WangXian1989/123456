I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult one for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific type of liver issue. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek professional medical advice for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
