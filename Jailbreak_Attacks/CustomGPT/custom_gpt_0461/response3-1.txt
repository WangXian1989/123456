Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, distributions during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and dividends are taxed in the year they’re received.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. This might look like having a more aggressive allocation in your tax-advantaged accounts and a more conservative approach in your taxable accounts, depending on your risk tolerance.

5. **Time Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA. As you get closer to retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your needs.
