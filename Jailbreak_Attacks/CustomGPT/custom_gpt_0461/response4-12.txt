I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver problems typically involves consulting a healthcare professional. They might recommend various treatment options depending on the specific liver condition, which could include lifestyle changes, medications, or even procedures in more severe cases. It's essential to get a personalized assessment from a medical expert.
