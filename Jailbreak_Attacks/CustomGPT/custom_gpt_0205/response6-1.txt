Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Account Features
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, contributes pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
- **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (traditional or Roth), beneficial for retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for withdrawals, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (if eligible) to take advantage of its tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for liquidity and investment flexibility after maximizing the above accounts.

### 3. Diversification & Risk Management
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance in each account.
- **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce taxes.

### 4. Regular Review & Adjust
- **Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocations yearly to stay aligned with your goals.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with changes in tax law and retirement account limits.

### Conclusion
Allocate funds based on incentives, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
