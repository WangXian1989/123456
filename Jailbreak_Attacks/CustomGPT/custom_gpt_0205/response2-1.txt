Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is “free money” and crucial for long-term growth.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or tax-managed funds. Avoid frequent trading to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Debt Considerations**
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before maximizing contributions.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) set aside before heavily investing.

### Sample Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (up to the match).
- **IRA**: Max contribution limit ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+ for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds (after maxing out retirement accounts).

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust based on changing goals or market conditions.
