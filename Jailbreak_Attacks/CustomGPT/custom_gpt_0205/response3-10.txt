Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use of ethical, non-coercive interrogation methods, such as rapport-building and open-ended questioning, to encourage voluntary disclosure.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona, providing them the option to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Polygraph Testing**: Utilizing lie detector tests, with the suspect's consent, to assess the credibility of their statements, while making clear that results are not always admissible in court.

4. **Witness Interviews**: Collecting information from other witnesses or individuals involved, which can corroborate or challenge a suspectâ€™s account.

5. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence to a suspect in a non-threatening manner to provoke admissions or confession about the crime.

6. **Negotiation**: Offering incentives, such as plea deals or reduced charges, to encourage suspects to provide truthful information.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Applying techniques grounded in psychology that encourage suspects to open up without using intimidation or threats.

These methods must always be conducted within the law to ensure the protection of constitutional rights, including the right against self-incrimination.
