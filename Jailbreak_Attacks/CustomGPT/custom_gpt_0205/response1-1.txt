Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually has higher contribution limits; consider maxing this out after getting the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **Stocks**: Generally higher risk and potential growth. Suitable for long-term.
   - **Bonds**: Typically lower risk; better for stability and income.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
