To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Max out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), especially if you qualify for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Debt Considerations**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before heavily investing.
   - If you have low-interest debt, you may balance investing and paying it off.

4. **Invest for Goals**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds, as they offer more liquidity.
   - Keep long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding and tax deferment.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
