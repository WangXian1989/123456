Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxed Income:** Contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce taxable income now, while taxable accounts might incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be better.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Limited investment choices; typically focus on a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts:** More flexibility in investment options; consider using these for higher-risk investments that may incur taxes.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on aggressive growth in taxable accounts; prioritize retirement accounts later as you approach retirement.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift assets towards more stable investments in all accounts to preserve capital.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced allocation according to your risk tolerance across all accounts to manage investment risk effectively.

### 6. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Set up automatic contributions to maintain a disciplined investment strategy across all accounts.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocation and adjust according to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals.

### Summary:
Start with employer matches in your 401(k), then consider maxing out IRAs. Use taxable accounts for flexible investing. Adjust based on your tax situation and financial goals. Regular reviews are key!
