Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. With a Roth IRA, you can withdraw tax-free in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Tax-free withdrawals make them attractive if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds needed before retirement or for flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Maintain a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set aside a consistent amount to invest across all accounts to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.
