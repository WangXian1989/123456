Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for a 401(k) (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those over 50) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus a $1,000 catch-up).
   - Choose a traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement, though youâ€™ll need to manage capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Shift your allocation based on how close you are to retirement. Younger investors may want more growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement should focus more on capital preservation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
