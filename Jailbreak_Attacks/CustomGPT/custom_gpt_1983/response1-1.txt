Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after-tax dollars; you'll owe capital gains taxes on earnings when you sell investments.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals: Use taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.
   - Long-term goals: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all account types to spread risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

Adjust allocations based on your life stage, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
