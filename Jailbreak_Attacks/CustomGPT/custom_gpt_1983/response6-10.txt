Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are a few key techniques:

### 1. **Interviewing Techniques**
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a friendly relationship to encourage openness.
   - **Active Listening**: Show genuine interest in the suspect's story, which can make them more willing to share information.

### 2. **Mirandizing**
   - **Providing Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.
   - **Documenting Consent**: Ensuring that any statements made are voluntary and recorded with consent.

### 3. **Truthful Conversation**
   - **Fact-Based Discussions**: Engaging in conversations that focus on facts rather than accusations can lead to more cooperation.
   - **Calm Environment**: Conducting interviews in a non-threatening setting to reduce anxiety and hostility.

### 4. **Non-Coercive Tactics**
   - **Use of Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to explain their side without leading them.
   - **Respect and Dignity**: Treating suspects with respect to foster an environment conducive to sharing.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while adhering to constitutional protections.
