Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **IRAs**: Contributions can be either pre-tax (Traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but are taxed later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep enough in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across all accounts to diversify and manage risk. Use tax-efficient strategies like holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable ones.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can greatly enhance your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a robust investment plan that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
