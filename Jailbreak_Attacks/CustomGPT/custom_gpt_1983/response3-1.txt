To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand each account's tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning taxes are owed upon withdrawal in retirement. Great for high-income earners.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year theyâ€™re realized. Ideal for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

### 2. **Prioritize accounts based on tax efficiency**:
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions first** to take advantage of any matching contributions.
   - **Contribute to traditional or Roth IRAs** next, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Invest in taxable accounts** last, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Consider investment types**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks) which may have higher potential for tax impact when sold.
   - Place income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually. Adjust contributions based on performance or life changes (like a new job, marriage, or children).

### 5. **Consult a financial advisor**:
   - Tailored advice based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can provide optimal strategies.

By balancing tax efficiency, investment types, and personal financial goals, you can create a healthy distribution across your accounts.
