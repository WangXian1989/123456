Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first due to their tax benefits.
   - **Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification of Assets**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, keeping in mind your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account in retirement, considering the tax implications of each withdrawal.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **Max out 401(k) up to the employer match**: 6% contribution.
- **Contribute maximum to IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

### Final Considerations
- **Regularly Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can optimize your portfolio according to your unique circumstances.
