The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRAs**:
   - If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be very beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any additional savings can be allocated to your taxable accounts. This is flexible and can be advantageous for short-term goals. Keep in mind the tax implications of dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Those in higher tax brackets may benefit from tax-deferred options like 401(k) and traditional IRAs.
   - Lower income earners may find Roth IRAs advantageous for their tax-free growth potential.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments can be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term savings could be better suited in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
