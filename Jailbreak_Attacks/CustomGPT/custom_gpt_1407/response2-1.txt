Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework to guide your allocation:

### 1. **Understand the Types of Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; often has employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; flexible in terms of contributions and withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Up to Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for bonds and higher-growth assets due to tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Use depending on whether it’s Roth (focus on higher-growth assets) or Traditional (bonds could be beneficial to reduce future taxes).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding dividend-producing stocks, tax-efficient funds/ETFs, or bonds, as they can offer better tax treatment.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Taxes**
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when selling assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For tailored advice considering personal circumstances, it's wise to consult a financial professional.

### 6. **Utilize Tools and Calculators**
   - Use retirement calculators to assess the right balance based on your retirement goals and timeline.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 30-40%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30-50%

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution varies by individual. Consider your situation, and adjust your contributions and allocations over time as your goals change.
