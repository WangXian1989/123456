Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, available in traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (after-tax) versions. Consider contributions limits and tax implications.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **Max Out 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially “free money.”
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.
- **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).
- **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve reached the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **401(k) and IRA**: Generally more suited for long-term growth. Invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and funds. Consider target-date funds if you're unsure about allocation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Tax-loss harvesting can also be useful.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**

- **Monitor Performance**: Review your accounts regularly (at least annually) to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Rebalance**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**

- **Withdrawals**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax liability. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help defer taxes on retirement account withdrawals.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

### Conclusion

Distributing your money effectively involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, investing strategically based on long-term goals, and regularly reviewing your investment strategy. Prioritize high-growth assets in retirement accounts while maintaining tax efficiency in taxable accounts.
