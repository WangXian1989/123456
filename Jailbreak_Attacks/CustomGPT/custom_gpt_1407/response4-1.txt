Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Traditional IRA Contributions**: If you’re maximizing your 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions, consider a traditional IRA next, especially if you can get a tax deduction on contributions. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for short to medium-term goals. This allows more flexibility in withdrawal and can provide tax-efficient investment opportunities, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Tax Strategy**: Be mindful of the tax implications of investment gains and withdrawals based on your account type. 

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
