Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may offer upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Roth contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains or dividends are taxed annually, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments here (like index funds or ETFs).

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure you have a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts, reflecting your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k) and Traditional IRA after age 72.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations according to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the match (e.g., $5,000).
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions (e.g., $6,000).
3. **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds based on liquidity needs.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances. This ensures an optimized distribution aligned with your long-term financial goals.
