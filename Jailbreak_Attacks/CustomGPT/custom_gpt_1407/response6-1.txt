Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest funds here once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts may produce taxable income, so consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - **Retirement Strategies**: Plan how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement with attention to tax implications, as withdrawals can affect your tax rate.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your financial strategy for growth and tax efficiency. If you have specific numbers or a breakdown of your situation, I can provide more tailored advice!
