Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually a free contribution).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income and tax bracket.
  
### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce current taxable income; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Favor investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity. Consider safer investments (e.g., bonds or money market funds).
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) that benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20-30% (max employer match)
- **IRA**: 20-30% (max contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60% (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts where possible, using taxable accounts for flexibility depending on your immediate financial needs and goals. Always consider your specific risk tolerance and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
