Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, contribute up to the annual limit. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect a higher tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Invest in taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. This allows for more flexible withdrawal options.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Align your investments by risk tolerance. Generally, growth-oriented assets belong in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts from dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Make sure to adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
