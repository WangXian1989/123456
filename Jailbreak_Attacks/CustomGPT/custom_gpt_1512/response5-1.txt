Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**  
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**  
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**  
   - Invest tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. High-turnover funds can generate tax liabilities.

### 4. **Diversification**  
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return. Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**  
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside retirement accounts to cover unforeseen expenses without disrupting your investment strategy.

### 6. **Rebalance as Needed**  
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**  
   - When nearing retirement, think about how you will withdraw from each account type for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion  
Creating a balanced approach tailored to your situation, tax status, and retirement plans can optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
