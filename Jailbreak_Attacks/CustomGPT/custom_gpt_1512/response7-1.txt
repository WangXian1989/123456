Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match if available. Then consider maxing out contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that may generate taxable income (like bonds or REITs) or for investments you plan to hold for a longer duration to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Savings**: Keep in a taxable account for easy access.
   - **Retirement Funds**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and tax flexibility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and enhance returns.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial objectives.
