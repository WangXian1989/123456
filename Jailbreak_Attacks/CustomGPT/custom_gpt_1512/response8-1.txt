Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you an immediate tax deduction.

2. **Prioritize Based on Taxation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) should hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments expected to generate interest or dividends, as these may be taxed annually.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, focus more on growth stocks in retirement accounts. As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Revisit your allocations regularly to adjust for changes in your goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation.

Remember to consider your eventual tax liabilities and the impact of withdrawals in retirement.
