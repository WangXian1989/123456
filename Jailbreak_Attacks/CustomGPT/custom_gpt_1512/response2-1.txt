Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. The match is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Typically, investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. It's wise to hold lower-turnover investments here (like index funds) to minimize taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income (traditional) or tax-free (Roth, if qualified). 

### 3. **Diversification Strategies:**
   - **Asset Location:** 
     - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes.
     - Keep equities in taxable accounts when possible, as long-term capital gains tax rates are usually lower than ordinary income rates.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth in 401(k) and IRAs, emphasizing stocks.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and adjust contributions across accounts based on performance, life events, and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (to max out employer match).
- **IRA:** 5% of income (to reach annual contribution limits).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining savings can be distributed based on overall investment strategy and goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
