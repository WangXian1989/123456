Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions. Aim to maximize annual contributions based on your financial situation.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After fully contributing to your IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit into retirement accounts, such as real estate or certain stocks. These are more suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth opportunities in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing financial goals.

Building a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon is key. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
