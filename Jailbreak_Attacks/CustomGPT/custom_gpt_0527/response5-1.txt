(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your age, investment goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford to, as it reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions, which can be useful if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional investments. Utilize tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s advisable to regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changing circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s a free pizza slice; itâ€™s a no-brainer! If you can swing it, max out your contributions. Think of it as locking in tax advantages while your money grows. 

2. **IRA**: If youâ€™re looking at a Roth IRA, itâ€™s like betting on your future self being in a higher tax bracket. A Traditional IRA? Great for dodging taxes now, which is a solid play if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket currently.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve filled up those other buckets, spill some into taxable investments. Just keep it tax-efficientâ€”think index funds and maybe even some tax-loss harvesting to keep those pesky capital gains in check.

So, ensure you tune into your financial goals and adjust your strategy as needed. Youâ€™ve got this!
