To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies tailored to your financial goals and situation:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+).

2. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred growth by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Distributions in retirement are typically taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Consider bonds or stable assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
  
5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while using your taxable account for liquidity.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes—consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs, if applicable).

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of taxes and investments, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

By balancing contributions and considering the tax implications at each step, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
