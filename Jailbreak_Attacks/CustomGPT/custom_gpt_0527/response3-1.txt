Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account allows for tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Accounts where investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Useful for short-term savings or specific investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Establish Financial Goals**
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. Taxable accounts are better for short-term needs due to their liquidity, while retirement accounts suit long-term growth.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to max out your contribution if you can.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and tax strategy).

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or are intended for short-term goals.

### 5. **Allocate Investments Wisely**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance in all accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds in taxable accounts. Higher turnover investments or those generating ordinary income might be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in financial circumstances, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match first.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions to an IRA if eligible (consider prioritizing Roth for tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional investments based on your immediate cash needs and tax situation.

This approach ensures you’re leveraging tax advantages while maintaining flexibility based on your needs.
