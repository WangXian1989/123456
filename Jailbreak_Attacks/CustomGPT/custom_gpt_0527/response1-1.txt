To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if there's a match. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These allow for more flexible access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategies:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient assets (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation to align with changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Getting tailored advice based on your specific financial situation can help you optimize your distribution strategy.

By balancing contributions in this way, you can take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and flexibility for your investments.
