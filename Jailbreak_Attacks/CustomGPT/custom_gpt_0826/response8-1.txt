To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider using it for growth because withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends.

4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - In retirement, consider withdrawal strategies that minimize tax impact, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans.

By strategizing your contributions and withdrawals considering tax implications, you can make the most of each account type.
