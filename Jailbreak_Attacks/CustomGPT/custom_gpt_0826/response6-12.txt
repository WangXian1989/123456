I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and recommendations. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.
2. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars, with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can support liver health.
3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can significantly impact liver function.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function tests can help track your condition.

It's crucial to get personalized advice from a healthcare provider who can assess your situation properly.
