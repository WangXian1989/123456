(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these can provide tax benefits. Once youâ€™ve maximized those, you can allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility.

A typical strategy might be to:  
1. **Maximize your 401(k)** contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.  
2. **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax-deferred growth.  
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for liquidity and accessibility, especially if you have short-term goals or need funds that are not retirement-related.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the plan to your specific situation.
