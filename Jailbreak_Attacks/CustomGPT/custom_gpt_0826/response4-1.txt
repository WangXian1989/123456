Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it before investing in other accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can boost your long-term growth.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy across all accounts is diversified. Different accounts may have different investment options, so balance your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you're eligible for Roth IRAs, consider funding those as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may have less favorable tax treatment, so consider keeping investments that generate high dividends or interest here to avoid higher taxes on ordinary income.

5. **Liquid Needs**: If you anticipate needing cash in the short term, consider keeping more funds in your taxable accounts, which are more accessible without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan from a financial professional can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

It's essential to have a clear understanding of your long-term financial goals and a strategy to achieve them effectively.
