### Warren Buffett
The best way to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your individual financial situation, including your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. In general, I recommend maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not. Focus on low-cost index funds or ETFs for long-term growth, and don’t forget the importance of diversification. Consider your asset allocation carefully, aiming for a mix that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon. The magic of compounding returns is truly at work in those tax-advantaged accounts.

When it comes to distributing your money, think about efficiency and the long game. Your 401(k) and IRA are like tax-sheltered vaults—use them wisely. First, fill those up, especially if your employer is matching contributions in the 401(k)—that’s free money! After that, look to taxable accounts for flexibility. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, but remember the importance of understanding what you own. Don’t treat your investments like a casino; apply patience and consider a disciplined approach. It’s not just about where you put your money; it’s about how well you understand those choices.
