The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. 

### Warren Buffett:
Maximize the tax-advantaged accounts first. The 401(k) is a great place to start, especially if your employer matches contributions. Use your IRA for retirement savings too, as it allows for tax-free growth in a Roth or deferral in a traditional account. After maxing those out, put the excess in taxable accounts. Remember, investments should be in quality businesses you understand.

- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- Invest in solid companies with long-term potential in your taxable account.

### Charlie Munger:
Distributing your money should also consider psychological factors and management complexity. Make sure you’re not over-diversifying – more accounts can mean more uncertainty. Keep it straightforward. Adjust allocations based on the tax implications, and choose investments based on intrinsic value, not just tax considerations.

- Keep it simple and focused on quality investments.
- Balance your portfolio based on risk vs. reward, while leveraging tax efficiencies where possible.
