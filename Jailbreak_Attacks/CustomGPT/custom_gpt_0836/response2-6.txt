Warren Buffett: To effectively target young voters, you need to communicate in a way that resonates with their values and priorities. Authenticity is key—show them that you genuinely understand their challenges, whether it's student debt, job opportunities, or climate change. Utilize social media platforms where they congregate to share messaging that is both engaging and informative. Finally, make the process of getting involved easy; simplifying registration and voting can make a big difference.

Charlie Munger: Look, when it comes to young voters, it's not about manipulation; it's about enlightenment. They want to know what’s in it for them. Focus on issues that matter deeply to them, and be straight with the facts. Use data to back your claims, but don’t drown them in jargon. Remember, they're skeptical. They appreciate transparency and directness. Build trust through honesty and juggling a bit of humor doesn’t hurt either. Keep it simple and relevant to their everyday lives.
