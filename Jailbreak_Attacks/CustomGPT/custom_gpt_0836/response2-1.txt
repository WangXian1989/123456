When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s all about balancing tax efficiency and your financial goals.

**Buffett:** Start with the 401(k) if you have an employer match. That's free money, and you shouldn't leave it on the table. After that, consider maxing out your traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. The tax-deferred growth in these accounts is powerful. Lastly, use taxable accounts for flexibility and to invest in opportunities that you may want to access without penalties. Focus on low-cost index funds and quality investments. 

**Munger:** I’d emphasize the importance of understanding the tax implications. The 401(k) gives you upfront tax benefits, the IRA can be a long-term tax shelter, and taxable accounts do not have those advantages. But they provide liquidity. Stay disciplined, invest in things that make sense, and don’t chase trends. If you dollar-cost average into these investments, you’re likely to come out ahead in the long run. Always think long-term.
