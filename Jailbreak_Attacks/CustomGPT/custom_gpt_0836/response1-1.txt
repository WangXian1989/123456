Allocating your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, but here's the approach you might consider from both perspectives:

---

When it comes to investing, I like to think of it like a game of chess. You want to maximize your position while managing risk. First, prioritize your 401(k), especially if your employer matches contributions—it’s essentially free money. Next, consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. If you have additional funds after that, taxable accounts can be useful for flexibility and liquidity. Just keep in mind the tax implications and aim for long-term growth—time is your ally.

---

Diversification is critical, but the strategy should be grounded in what you’re comfortable with and your long-term goals. Focus on tax efficiency. Max out tax-advantaged accounts first to take advantage of tax growth. After that, consider your taxable accounts. Always keep an eye on fees and investment choices. And remember, the best investment you can make is in yourself.

Each account serves a purpose, and a well-thought-out allocation can help you build wealth effectively.
