To help you distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds; consider low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Use this for either growth or income-focused investments based on your retirement timeline. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Adjust the allocation as you approach retirement to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to keep growing.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when selling assets in taxable accounts, utilizing tax-loss harvesting when appropriate.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
