When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines for optimal allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Tax Treatments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (traditional 401(k) and IRA) because they can reduce your current taxable income. Depending on your income and tax bracket, you may want to consider Roth options (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts do not have the same tax benefits but offer flexibility. Use these accounts for emergency funds or short-term goals.

3. **Consider Investment Options:** 
   - Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has limited investment choices or high fees, consider prioritizing IRA contributions instead.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that might incur long-term capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, which are generally more tax-efficient.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a money-market fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Factor in your age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance when distributing funds. Younger investors might opt for aggressive growth strategies, while those closer to retirement may seek more conservative allocations.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your investment goals and market conditions.

7. **Tax Perspective:** Consider your current tax situation and expected tax rates during retirement when deciding on contributing to traditional versus Roth accounts.

8. **Professional Advice:** If you're unsure, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals and situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while optimizing for growth and tax efficiency.
