Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-deferred account, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw them in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may provide a tax deduction now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable accounts**: These don't have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility. Capital gains are taxed, but you can control when you sell investments to manage your tax burden.

3. **Diversify investments**: Across all accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments to reduce risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider your liquidity needs**: Taxable accounts are generally more liquid and can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Account for retirement age and withdrawal strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy. The order of withdrawals (e.g., taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer) can impact your tax situation.

6. **Seek professional advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you meet both short-term and long-term financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
