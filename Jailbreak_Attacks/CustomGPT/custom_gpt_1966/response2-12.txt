I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the most accurate advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and other individual factors. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and refined sugars.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting drug use.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, there may be medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
   - Managing complications related to liver disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: 
   - Consulting with a dietitian to manage nutritional needs.

Please make an appointment with a healthcare provider for personalized care and recommendations.
