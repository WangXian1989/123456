The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket, this can be beneficial. Additionally, some 401(k) plans offer a Roth option for after-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Hold more aggressive or high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return. This can apply across all account types.

5. **Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk tolerance should dictate your investment approach. Younger investors might focus on growth-oriented investments, while older investors may prioritize capital preservation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments and periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and financial goals.
