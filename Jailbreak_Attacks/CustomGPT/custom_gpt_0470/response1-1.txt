When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, consider the employer match; contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a Roth, it can be powerful for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-advantaged but offer flexibility (no penalties for early withdrawal) and you can control the capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and consider keeping more liquid or shorter-term investments in a taxable account.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your comfort with risk should dictate your investment choices within each account. Higher-risk investments may be more suitable for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs), while moderate-risk investments could fit well in a taxable account for more immediate access.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If retirement is many years away, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, as they benefit from compounding. If you’re closer to retirement, consider balancing liquidity with growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how and when you’ll access these funds. Use tax-advantaged accounts strategically to minimize tax impacts at retirement.

### Suggested Approach:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Maximize contributions to an IRA (either type) if you qualify.
3. Consider the remainder for investments in a taxable account, especially for short-term goals or more accessible funds.

### Conclusion:
Each type of account serves its purpose, and the right mix depends on your personal financial situation, goals, and timeline. Diversifying how you invest can create a more balanced financial portfolio. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
