When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally be funded after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Gains are subject to capital gains tax, but you have the flexibility to access funds without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes, while utilizing taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) that generate taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and provide growth opportunities. Ensure youâ€™re not overexposed to the same assets in multiple accounts.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - The money in your 401(k) and IRA is typically for long-term growth, while funds in taxable accounts might be more fluid, requiring different strategies based on when you might need access to that capital.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
