The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to retirement accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can lead to greater long-term growth.

   - **401(k)**: If you can contribute more after receiving the match, consider doing so. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax) based on your tax bracket and eligibility. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, consider:
   - Stocks for long-term growth potential.
   - Bonds for stability and income.
   - Alternative investments for further diversification.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantage accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These funds offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for shorter-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investments to ensure you're maintaining your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, so it’s wise to evaluate your goals and adjust your contributions as needed.
