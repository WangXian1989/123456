To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deductible contributions, similar to a 401(k). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings (dividends, interest, capital gains) are subject to capital gains tax, which can affect your overall tax liability.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before contributing to an IRA. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Investment Options**: Assess the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexible withdrawal options compared to retirement accounts, where early withdrawals may incur penalties.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Your investment horizon and retirement timeline can influence your strategy. Younger investors may favor growth-oriented investments, while those approaching retirement may prioritize capital preservation.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you meet the annual limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any extra savings to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Reassess Regularly:
Monitor your investment strategy periodically and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution depends on individual financial situations, tax implications, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor might help tailor a strategy that works best for your circumstances.
