Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim to maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, focusing on tax advantages based on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or municipal bonds. Consider keeping high-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from potential long-term growth.

3. **Risk Profile**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards equities in growth accounts, while those nearing retirement might prefer stable bonds.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Assess your asset allocation periodically, especially after significant life events or market changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
