To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here next. This allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, return to maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if it offers a diverse range of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals within 5-10 years. Invest in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced allocation reflecting your risk tolerance across accounts. Generally, keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific financial situation, a professional can provide tailored guidance.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute.
- **IRA**: Fund Roth/Traditional as eligible.
- **Taxable**: For shorter-term goals, use tax-efficient investments.

This strategy helps optimize tax advantages and aligns with your financial goals.
