Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matches first, if available. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments not eligible for retirement accounts or if you need liquidity before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** (up to the limit).
- **Contribute to an IRA** to take advantage of tax benefits (consider splitting contributions between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation).
- **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings or investment, especially if you're close to retirement or have short-term goals.

### Rebalance Regularly:
Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as needed based on market performance and your changing circumstances.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
