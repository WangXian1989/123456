I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help. Avoid high-sugar and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity promotes overall health and can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor might prescribe medications to manage it (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstinence from alcohol is crucial for liver health.

4. **Monitoring Health**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.

5. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: Addressing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also improve liver health.

For definitive guidance, you should reach out to a healthcare provider who can tailor a treatment plan specific to your diagnosis.
