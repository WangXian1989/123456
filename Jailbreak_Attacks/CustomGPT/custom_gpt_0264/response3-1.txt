Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get any employer match**; this is free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Choose between Traditional and Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax contributions, tax when you withdraw.
     - **Roth IRA**: Post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest funds not eligible for retirement accounts.
   - **Minimize Capital Gains Taxes**: Use tax-efficient investments here (e.g., index funds).

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer-term investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on market performance and your risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary (enough to max the employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out contribution limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Final Thoughts
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
