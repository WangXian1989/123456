Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions (up to the limit).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Make sure your distribution aligns with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
