Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for potential tax benefits. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age. They allow for more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix based on your comfort with risk. Stocks generally offer higher growth but are more volatile.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer investment horizons can usually afford more risk.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep higher-yield investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains for lower tax rates.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit.
- **Taxable**: Invest any remaining funds based on your risk tolerance and liquidity needs.

### Regular Reviews
- Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance, tax law changes, and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
