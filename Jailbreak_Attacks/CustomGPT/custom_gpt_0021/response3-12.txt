For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (like Hepatitis B or C), antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Protectants**: Certain supplements, like milk thistle, may support liver health.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Completely abstaining from alcohol can prevent further damage.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treat conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure that may affect liver health.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis.
