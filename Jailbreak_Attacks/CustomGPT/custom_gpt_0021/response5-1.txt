Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Prioritize maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional), or qualified withdrawals can be tax-free (Roth). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments with lower tax implications (like index funds) or for funds needed in the short term.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term growth is ideal for retirement accounts, while taxable accounts can have more flexibility for short-term needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs. Max out these accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts.

4. **Strategies**:
   - Consider using tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts in line with your overall asset allocation strategy.

A balanced approach, focusing on tax efficiency and aligning investments with your goals, will help you maximize returns. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
