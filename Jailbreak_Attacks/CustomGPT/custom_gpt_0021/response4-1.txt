Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax bracket. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged options, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts that benefit from tax deferment (401(k) and IRA). Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to avoid high taxes on ordinary income.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continuously review your portfolio and rebalance as needed based on investment performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consider Future Tax Impacts**:
   - Keep in mind expected tax rates in retirement. If you believe taxes might be higher, leaning more towards a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can optimize your specific situation based on your age, income, and retirement goals.

This strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
