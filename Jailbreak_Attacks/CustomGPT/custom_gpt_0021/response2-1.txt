The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more immediate goals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income; consider maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here will be subject to capital gains taxes when sold, so choose investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions annually, if possible.
   - **Watch Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) contributions and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if age 50+).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or stock funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly REITs or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds or tax-managed funds.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your goals and market conditions change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.

### Example of Distribution Strategy:
- **60% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA (split between traditional and Roth)**
- **10% in Taxable Accounts**

This strategy can change based on your specific circumstances, so it's essential to stay flexible and review periodically.
