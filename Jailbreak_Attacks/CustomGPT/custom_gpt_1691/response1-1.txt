Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. They offer tax benefits that can boost your savings over time.

3. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maximizing investments.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes in each account for balance. Consider a combination of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility, but you’ll need to manage taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific situation.
