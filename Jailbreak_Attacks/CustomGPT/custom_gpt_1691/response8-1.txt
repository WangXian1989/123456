To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After employer match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement or for assets that generate capital gains, as they are taxed differently.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix, adjusting contributions as needed.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
