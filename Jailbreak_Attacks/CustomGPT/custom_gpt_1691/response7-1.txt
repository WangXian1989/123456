Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here's a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction when you contribute.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach your desired contribution limit. This account offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and investment options but may be taxed on capital gains.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you plan to access funds before retirement, lean towards taxable accounts for more liquidity. 

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk. 

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or investment goals.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
