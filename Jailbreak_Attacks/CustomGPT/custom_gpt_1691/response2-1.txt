Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match limit for free money. These contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you may need before retirement. Consider investments that generate capital gains rather than income to minimize taxes.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline. If you're decades away, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If retirement is near, balance withdrawals from all accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth, and keep conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Keep a portion in easily accessible funds (like a savings account) for emergencies instead of locking everything away in retirement accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, personalized advice can ensure optimized distribution tailored to your specific goals and needs.

Overall, start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and investment growth.
