Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, focus on paying that down before investing heavily.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

4. **Maximize Contributions**: Once you’re contributing to both accounts, aim to max out your contributions to the 401(k) and IRA, if possible, with current limits.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility and liquidity.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, as taxes are delayed.

7. **Review Annually**: Reassess your distribution and investment strategy annually to adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable for tailored advice.
