(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to reach this match before diverting funds elsewhere.
2. **IRA**: Consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA as it offers tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

Evaluate your current tax bracket, retirement timeline, and investment options in each account to optimize their respective benefits.

1. **401(k)**: Dude, donâ€™t leave money on the table! Snag that employer match ASAP. Max it out if you can because those tax benefits are sweet. Just remember, youâ€™re locking it down until retirementâ€”no early withdrawals unless you like penalties.
   
2. **IRA**: Traditional or Roth? Go Roth if you think your future self will be swimming in cash! But if tax deduction now is your jam, Traditional might float your boat. Fully fund that puppy to get the max tax advantage.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is the wild westâ€”no rules! Use these for stuff you want or need before retirement, like that new car or a trip to Bali. Just know youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and gains, so keep that in mind!

So, play it smart, diversify, and keep an eye on those taxes! Youâ€™ll thank yourself later.
