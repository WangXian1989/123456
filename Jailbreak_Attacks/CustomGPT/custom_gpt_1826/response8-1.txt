When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions in your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 for 2024 (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 for 2024 (plus a $1,000 catch-up if you’re over 50).
  
3. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: For accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) for long-term growth, as they defer taxes on gains until withdrawal.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you expect to need some funds before retirement, distribute some money to taxable accounts, as they offer liquidity and flexibility without penalties for withdrawal before retirement age.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio to reduce risk. Consider factors like your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

6. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of how selling investments in taxable accounts will affect your taxes. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Regularly reassess your strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and changes in tax laws.
