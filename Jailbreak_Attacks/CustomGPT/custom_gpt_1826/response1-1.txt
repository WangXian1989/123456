To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Taxation Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Prioritize holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to reduce tax liability.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50 for 2023).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50 for 2023).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but investment contributions are after-tax.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for retirement withdrawals based on tax implications, withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and tax status can maximize your return.

This staggered approach can enhance your overall financial health and ensure you're optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
