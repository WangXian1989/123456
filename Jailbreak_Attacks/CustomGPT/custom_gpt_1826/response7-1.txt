The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $23,000 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50)
   - IRA: $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50)

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize pre-tax contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Consider Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Investment Strategy**: For long-term growth, lean towards stocks and equity funds in accounts that have tax advantages. You may want to hold more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to cash within a few years, balance your investments to maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts, since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your portfolio to adjust allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

It's generally advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique goals and circumstances.
