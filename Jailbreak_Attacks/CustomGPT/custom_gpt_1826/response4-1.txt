Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency:** Taxable accounts are typically less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on earnings. Use them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) can be beneficial. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more suitable.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographic exposure.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your investment allocations regularly and rebalance your portfolios as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals:** Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Different accounts have different rules about withdrawals, which can affect your tax situation in retirement.

Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
