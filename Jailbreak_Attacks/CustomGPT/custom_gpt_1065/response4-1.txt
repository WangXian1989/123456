I'm unable to provide personalized financial advice. However, I can give you a general overview of strategies for distributing funds among different types of retirement and investment accounts.

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Decide between a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Similar to 401(k), invest in a diverse array of assets, considering both individual stocks and index funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use these accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund to avoid dipping into retirement accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Evaluate your overall asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

5. **Consultation**: It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan that fits your individual circumstances.

Always remember to assess your investment strategy periodically to adapt to any changes in market conditions or personal financial situations.
