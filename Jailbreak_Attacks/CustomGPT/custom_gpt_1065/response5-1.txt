(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, retirement goals, current financial situation, and tax implications. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your contributions, as these funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to maximize contributions to this account as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need before retirement or for investments that can benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates. This is also a good place for investments like municipal bonds or ETFs that generate qualified dividends to minimize tax liability.

Consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best way to juggle your money among a 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts is like figuring out the ultimate party guest listâ€”it's all about balance, strategy, and a bit of flair!

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your job's throwing in matching funds, throw as much cash as you can at that! Get that free money! Once you snag the full match, keep pumping in cashâ€”max it out if you can! Tax-deferred growth is like planting a money tree for your golden years!

2. **IRA**: Now, letâ€™s talk IRAs. If youâ€™re feeling like youâ€™ll have a lower income in retirement, go for the traditional IRAâ€”the tax deduction right now feels sweet. But if you want to enjoy tax-free dollars later, snatch that Roth IRA like it's the last slice of pizza at a party. Just remember, the contribution limits are like a VIP guest listâ€”there's only so much room.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss some cash into your taxable accounts for those "just in case" momentsâ€”maybe for a vacation or a new toy! And think about investment types that donâ€™t kick the tax man too hard. Go for some ETFs or long-term investments that can help you dodge the tax traps!

Ultimately, consult a financial whiz to make sure youâ€™re not just winging it! Youâ€™ve got this!
