Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment objectives. Hereâ€™s a structured way to think about it:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; the limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:** Maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+), with potential tax-deductible options depending on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limit, but consider capital gains taxes on gains realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Tax-deferred growth helps in compounding returns.
     - If applicable, utilize Roth options to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Fund an IRA:**
     - Choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for additional savings/expenses or investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Diversify investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:**
     - Review asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### 4. **Emergency and Short-Term Funds**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before maximizing retirement contributions.

### 5. **Consult Financial Guidelines**
   - Work with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your unique situation, including risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### Summary:
- **Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.**
- **Constantly reassess and adjust your strategy as needed.** 

This strategic distribution approach will effectively enhance your long-term financial growth while considering tax efficiency.
