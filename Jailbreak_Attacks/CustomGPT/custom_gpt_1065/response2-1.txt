Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax-advantaged growth. Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility with fewer restrictions on withdrawals. Gains are taxed as capital gains based on your income bracket.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Check the current contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limits as of 2023 are $22,500 for individuals under 50).

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s free money.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before maxing out retirement accounts.
   - **Debt Repayment:** Consider high-interest debt repayment before aggressive investing.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Consider your tax bracket for current and future years. If you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:** Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies from these accounts in retirement can significantly impact your tax liability.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Often suitable for long-term growth investments with a focus on stocks or a balanced approach based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Tailor investments based on your specific retirement goals; use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other vehicles appropriate for your timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains rates) and avoid high-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
- Allocate any additional funds to your taxable account, focusing on long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

### Summary:
Strategically distributing funds across these accounts maximizes tax advantages and aligns with your long-term financial goals. Regular assessments and adjustments will help ensure that your allocation remains effective.
