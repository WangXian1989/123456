To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Distribution Strategy

1. **401(k) Account:**
   - **Contribution Maximization:** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds to increase long-term growth potential.

2. **IRA Account (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:**
     - *Traditional IRA:* Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed.
     - *Roth IRA:* Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquid Funds**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for immediate needs or short-term goals. 
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation:** Maintain an overall asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.
- **Rebalance:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it stays aligned with your investment goals.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy balances maximizing tax advantages while also ensuring liquidity for short-term needs. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
