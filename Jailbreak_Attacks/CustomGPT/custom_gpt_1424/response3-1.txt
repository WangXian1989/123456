When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep these factors in mind:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax if it's a Roth 401(k)), which reduces your taxable income. Employer matches are also a benefit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income is taxed annually, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize employer matching in your 401(k) first.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties, whereas 401(k) and IRA funds are typically tied up until retirement age.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all account types, considering asset allocation in relation to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA, especially a Roth for tax-free growth.
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After the IRA, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
4. **Fund a Taxable Account**: Use extra funds to invest in a taxable account for flexibility and short-term goals.

### Adjustment and Review:
- Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions. 

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals.
