Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- Fund a taxable account after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This offers liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income; hold investments expected to grow significantly here.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains (lower tax rates).

### 4. Adjust Based on Life Stage
- Younger investors can be more aggressive in growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more stable, income-generating assets.

### Summary
- Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for added liquidity and flexibility.
- Reassess your allocation periodically based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
