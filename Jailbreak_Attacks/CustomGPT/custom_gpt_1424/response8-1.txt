Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Good for higher earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also potentially tax-deductible, but with income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for other investments but subject to capital gains tax. 

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in cash or cash equivalents before heavily investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread funds across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

5. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: More risk may be suitable for retirement accounts where funds are long-term, while a conservative approach may be better for taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations annually or after significant life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
