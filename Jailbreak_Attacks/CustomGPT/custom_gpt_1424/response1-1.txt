Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Plan**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Consider Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals later. In contrast, a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed annually to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for savings goals with a shorter time horizon or for investments that might generate taxable events, like dividends or capital gains.
   - **Allocate Investments Wisely**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your strategy.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can ensure your strategy fits your specific situation.

### Considerations:
- Age: Younger investors may lean more toward growth assets, while those near retirement might prefer stability.
- Time Horizon: Longer timelines typically allow for riskier investments.
  
Adjustments should be made based on your individual circumstances and goals!
