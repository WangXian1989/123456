Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After the match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts are great for short-term goals or for investments you may need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - When you retire, have a strategy for withdrawing from these accounts. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-advantaged accounts grow for longer.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential and minimize taxes over time.
