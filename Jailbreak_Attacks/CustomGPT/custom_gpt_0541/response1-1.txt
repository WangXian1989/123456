Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now. This is great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, similar to a 401(k).
     - Roth IRAs are funded with post-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure your investments align with your risk tolerance. Stocks might be best for long-term growth, while bonds could provide stability.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts or if you want liquidity, invest in a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

5. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation can change. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on your goals, market conditions, and ages.

6. **Withdrawals and Timeframe**: Consider how soon you’ll need access to the funds. Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts if you might need them earlier.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for you!
