The optimal strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA better suits your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may have lower tax implications, such as index funds or municipal bonds.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Liquidity Needs**
   - If you're closer to retirement, shifting more funds into safer investments might be prudent, while younger investors can often afford to take on more risk in pursuit of growth.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Financial markets fluctuate, so regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
- **Contribute to 401(k) up to the employer match.**
- **Consider tax implications when investing in taxable accounts.**
- **Adjust strategy based on market conditions and life changes.**

Ultimately, the best approach is tailored to your unique situation, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
