To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check your employer's contribution match and aim to contribute enough to get the full match. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you'll face capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Utilize your 401(k) and IRA to reduce taxable income now. Rely on taxable accounts for funds beyond these limits or for shorter-term needs.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts, as they usually produce less taxable income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for the Future**: Know the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account. In general, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, followed by tax-deferred accounts, then tax-free accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) to lock in taxes now. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

### Summary
1. Max out employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions to receive any match.
2. Contribute to an IRA, considering both traditional and Roth options based on your tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility.
4. Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and investment choices for tax efficiency. 

### Consult a Financial Advisor
It's advisable to meet with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
