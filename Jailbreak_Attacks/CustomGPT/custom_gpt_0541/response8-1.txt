Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which helps in reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits. It might be strategic to hold assets for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Dividend Stocks**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or dividend stocks that may qualify for lower tax rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match.
2. Decide on the type of IRA (Traditional vs. Roth) based on your tax situation and future income expectations.
3. After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate excess funds to a taxable account for additional growth and flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- **Adjust as Necessary**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax law, and financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly; consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both short-term needs and long-term retirement goals is key.
