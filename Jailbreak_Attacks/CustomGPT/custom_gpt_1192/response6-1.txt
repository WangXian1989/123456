When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a strategic approach can help optimize your overall investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
     - **IRA:** Consider whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or have lower tax implications in the long run.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals:**
     - Allocate more aggressive investments in retirement accounts (which have longer time horizons).
     - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments that may be needed in the near term.
   - **Diversification:** Keep a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before diverting to taxable accounts.
   - Consider catch-up contributions if you are over 50.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - When you retire, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA after age 72.

### Conclusion:
Establish a balanced approach that accounts for tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on life changes and market conditions. It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
