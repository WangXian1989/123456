Creating an effective distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw funds in retirement. Some employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax advantages to a 401(k), with both Traditional and Roth options. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon selling and may generate taxable income. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older) and for IRAs it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, you might want high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax efficiency, while holding bonds or stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-yielding investments (like REITs or certain bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on income, while keeping lower-yielding investments in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - When you start withdrawing funds, consider tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. After those are depleted, withdraw from tax-deferred accounts, paying attention to tax brackets.

6. **Regular Review:**
   - Revisit your investment strategy periodically (at least annually) to adjust for life changes, market conditions, and to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always remember that personal finance is just that—personal. What works best will depend on your unique circumstances.
