The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA. The tax-free growth can be beneficial for long-term investments.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Adv advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on filling up tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate higher taxable income, such as bonds or real estate, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in the future.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund set aside in a liquid account before allocating large amounts to investment accounts.

### 6. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This helps in managing risk while aiming for returns.

### 7. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance accordingly to maintain your desired risk level.

### 8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor may help you tailor your investment distribution to your specific situation.

Always consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline when making investment decisions, and stay informed about changes in tax regulations or retirement account rules.
