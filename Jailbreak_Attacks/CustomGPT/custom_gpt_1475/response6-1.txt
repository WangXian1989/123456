The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors including your current tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), prioritize liquid investments in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term growth, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and asset allocation strategy.
   - Monitor and rebalance periodically, considering tax implications for trades, especially in taxable accounts.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your individual situation can provide personalized recommendations.
