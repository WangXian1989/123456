Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are generally $22,500 for 401(k) plans (plus an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Keep in mind that each account can host a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.), and consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you are in a lower tax bracket, consider holding investments that generate capital gains in taxable accounts, as these may be taxed at a lower rate. Avoid holding high-yield bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts due to potentially high taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw your funds in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Adjust your contributions based on your current financial needs and long-term goals.
