I'm not a doctor, but some general treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limiting alcohol intake.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections (like antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant might be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan for your specific situation.
