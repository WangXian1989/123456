When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you might benefit from tax-advantaged growth by contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though you'll be responsible for capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. For instance, higher growth investments (like stocks) may be kept in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications on gains, while more stable investments could be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess the performance of your accounts and rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

It's essential to reassess your strategy regularly as your financial situation and goals evolve.
