Regarding your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Great for employer matching, if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth with contributions that may be tax-deductible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs. Max out employer match and then consider IRAs.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your comfort with risk. 401(k) and IRA investments are often more aggressive, while taxable accounts can be more conservative.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions** (up to the employer match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts** for additional savings or specific goals.

### Regular Review
- **Monitor and adjust** your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.
