To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax and lower your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits to a 401(k).
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No immediate tax benefits, but capital gains tax applies only when selling investments.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for compounding.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Check annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Contribute to your IRA next for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds for flexibility and access.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 30%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 40%

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while maintaining liquidity.
