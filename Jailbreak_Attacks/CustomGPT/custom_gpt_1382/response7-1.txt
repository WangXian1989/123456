To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay within annual limits (for 2024, it's $6,500 for under 50 and $7,500 for 50+).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you've maxed out retirement accounts.
   - **Invest Wisely:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Guidelines
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ expenses saved in a liquid account.
- **Diversification:** Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Regular Review:** Adjust allocations periodically based on life changes or market conditions.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** 15% of your income.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable:** Invest remaining funds based on your goals.
