When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Understand Each Account's Benefits
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Diversification of Investments
- Allocate investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. Adjust Based on Age and Goals
- Your age and retirement goals will impact how much to allocate to each account. Generally, younger investors can afford more risk, while those closer to retirement may want more stability.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income.
- **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds after maxing out other accounts.

### Regular Review
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.
