I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Generally, treatment may depend on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or others. Options could include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Always seek personalized advice from a qualified medical provider.
