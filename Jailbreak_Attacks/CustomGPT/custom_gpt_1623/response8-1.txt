When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize funding IRAs (Roth or traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match, as these accounts provide tax benefits for retirement savings. Choose a Roth option if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Brackets**: Consider your current tax bracket and projected future tax bracket. If you are in a low tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous.

4. **Balance Contributions**: If you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, focus on your taxable accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**: Ensure you also have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts before investing excess funds.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to spread your risk effectively and consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation among these accounts to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
