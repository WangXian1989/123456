To efficiently distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and eligibility, contribute to a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions).

2. **Balance and Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider putting more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Keep an Eye on Taxes:**
   - **Minimize Taxable Income**: Utilize tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains. Rebalance your portfolio strategically from a tax perspective.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impacts, such as avoiding a spike in taxable income from large withdrawals.

By following these principles and adjusting based on personal circumstances, you can optimize your financial strategy for future growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on current regulations and your financial situation.
