Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking for immediate tax deductions, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), allocate funds to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax strategy.
   - Once those accounts are maxed out (up to annual limits), you can fill up your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets that generate lower taxable income here (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in your taxable account to offset gains.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Put higher growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on their growth.
   - Keep income-generating investments (such as bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize annual tax hits.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals in case of immediate needs.

6. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws change over time. Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to make necessary adjustments.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy depends on your personal financial situation, so consulting a financial advisor may provide tailored insights specific to your circumstances.
