To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account; often comes with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts subject to taxes on gains, dividends, and interest.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money".

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts** (401(k), Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed yearly, and capital gains are taxed upon sale.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Aim for a balanced approach: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in a taxable account.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) with an additional $7,500 if you are 50 or older, and $6,500 for IRAs with another $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.

5. **Prioritize According to Your Goals**:
   - If retirement is your main goal, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - For short-term goals, such as buying a house or funding education, focus more on taxable accounts.

6. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Choose investments wisely based on account type. Income-generating investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while growth investments may be better for Roth IRAs or taxable accounts.

7. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Monitor your investments and allocations regularly. Adjust contributions based on changes in goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If necessary, obtain personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that maximizes growth while being mindful of tax implications.
