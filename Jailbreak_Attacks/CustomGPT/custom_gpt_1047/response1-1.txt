To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match. It's free money and provides an immediate 100% return on that portion of your contribution.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Once you've secured the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and max it out if possible, as it offers tax advantages similar to an IRA but with potentially higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing your retirement accounts, investing in taxable accounts can provide more flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalties and are useful for shorter-term goals but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Remember, this is a general guideline. Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
