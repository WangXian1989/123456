When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often involves several key considerations related to your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax (or Roth after-tax), which can reduce taxable income now or in retirement. However, distributions are taxable, so consider your future tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs can also provide tax advantages, similar to 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. You may want higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, where you can benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have a robust emergency fund in a taxable account for quick access without tax penalties.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy based on the tax impacts at retirement. It might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your retirement accounts to grow tax-deferred longer.

6. **Age Considerations:** As you approach retirement, you might want to shift your asset allocation to more conservative investments, keeping in mind the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA once you turn 72.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of your specific financial situation, a consultation with a financial advisor can provide personal guidance tailored to your needs.

In summary, start by taking full advantage of employer matches, consider your tax situation, diversify your investments, maintain an emergency fund, develop a thoughtful withdrawal strategy, and review your asset allocation as you age.
