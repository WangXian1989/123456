The best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income level. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k) and traditional IRA): These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you will pay taxes on capital gains and dividends here, they offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, keep a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes in Retirement**: Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. A mix of taxable and tax-deferred accounts allows for strategic withdrawals that can help manage your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Periodic Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market changes, your financial circumstances, and retirement goals. 

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
