Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: First, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**: Different accounts have different tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals), plan your contributions accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. It's often best to hold assets that generate income (like bonds or stocks with dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all three types of accounts. This can help mitigate risk and optimize returns over time. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you might withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, it might be advantageous to withdraw from taxable investment accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual circumstances, it’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
