I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to get the best advice tailored to your specific liver problem. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the condition you’re facing. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or even medical procedures in some cases. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified medical professional. Take care of your health!
