The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions. Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer to pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't provide tax advantages but offer flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties. You'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, you may want to be more aggressive with your investments in tax-advantaged accounts (more stocks, less bonds).
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This helps manage risk.

5. **Review Contributions Annually**: Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation, goals, and any changes in tax laws.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**: 401(k) plans sometimes have higher fees and limited investment options. Compare this to IRAs and taxable accounts to find where you can get the best returns.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice specific to your financial situation can be very beneficial.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your unique circumstances, so it’s wise to reassess your strategy regularly.
