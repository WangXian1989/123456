The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible, and the same tax rules apply as with a 401(k) upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, uses after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed when realized, and dividends and interest are also subject to tax. Consider using these accounts for investments that are less likely to generate short-term capital gains or for funds you might need before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine when youâ€™ll need access to the funds. Use retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term goals and keep the taxable account for shorter-term needs or emergencies.
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring you're aligned with your overall financial strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to prioritize taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation and goals.
