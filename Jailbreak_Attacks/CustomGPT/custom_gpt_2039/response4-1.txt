Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible IRA, consider maxing out this account next. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or certain funds) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), while more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is balanced according to your risk tolerance, regardless of which account holds which investments.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on the tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice is invaluable. A financial advisor can help you create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.

Remember to review your allocations periodically, especially as your life circumstances and market conditions change.
