Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimizing your investment across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributing to these accounts can lower your taxable income now. Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts before taxable accounts. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments. They can hold assets that generate less taxable income or have favorable tax treatment, like long-term investments.

3. **Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 or older) and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're aged 50 or older). 

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings or money market account that covers 3-6 months of expenses before fully investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Account Types and Investments**:
   - For the **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**, consider investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance, as withdrawals are typically taxed.
   - For a **Roth IRA** (if you have one), consider putting investments with high growth potential because qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of their withdrawals. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments within each account type, aiming for a balanced portfolio based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

8. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Engaging in a combination of these strategies can help ensure that you are optimizing your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work towards your financial goals.
