Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions, especially if in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for needs within 5-10 years. This keeps your funds accessible without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, particularly if you're investing for the long term.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding investments for over a year can qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income (Traditional) or not taxed at all (Roth).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Divvy up investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents tailored to each account's purpose.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes (like marriage, children, etc.).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

By strategically balancing contributions and considering your financial objectives, you can optimize your savings and investment growth.
