Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions may reduce taxable income and grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth, possibly reducing taxable income. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Useful for short-term goals and provides flexibility for withdrawals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** (up to the employer match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably maxing out Roth if eligible).
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for any additional funds or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Rebalancing:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations.
