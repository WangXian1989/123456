Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out IRA or Roth IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit you in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Once you hit the IRA limit, contribute more to your 401(k) if you haven’t maximized it yet.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions don't reduce taxable income immediately, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so they can be useful for flexibility and access before retirement age.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in liquid assets or taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider equities in growth accounts and fixed income in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, plan how you’ll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it’s efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
