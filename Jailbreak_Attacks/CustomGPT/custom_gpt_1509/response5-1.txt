Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA can be more beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k):**
   - After fully funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged options. This can be important for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments, which may produce less immediate income.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation, investment performance, and contributions to ensure you’re on track to meet your retirement goals.
