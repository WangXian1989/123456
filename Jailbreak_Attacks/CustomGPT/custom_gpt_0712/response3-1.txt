To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and realized capital gains, which can reduce overall returns.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that are expected to grow significantly, such as stocks.
   - Place more stable, lower-growth investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk. Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account, and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. You might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from Roth accounts.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**: At least annually, review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
