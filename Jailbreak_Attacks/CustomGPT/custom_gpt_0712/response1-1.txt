To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford to, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be more suitable.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Determine how soon you'll need access to your funds. Taxable accounts are typically better for shorter-term goals since they allow for easier access.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. 
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) or less tax-efficient assets in your taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversify Your Portfolio**:
   - Ensure you're well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

5. **Review Your Contributions Annually**:
   - Regularly evaluate your investment performance and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your personal situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

By balancing contributions and asset allocation across these accounts, you can optimize your long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
