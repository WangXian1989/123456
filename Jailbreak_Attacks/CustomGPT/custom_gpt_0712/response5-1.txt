(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potentially better tax treatment.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

Also, itâ€™s essential to consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when allocating investments.

Aim to contribute at least enough to nab that match. Then, if your income allows, dive into an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional depends on whether you want to deal with taxes now or later. 

Once you've milked those accounts dry, throw any leftover cash into your taxable accounts for flexibility. Just remember, funds in taxable accounts get hit with cap gains tax, so choose investments wisely. Diversify like a boss, matching your risk appetite with a mix of stocks, bonds, and maybe some fun ETFs. Happy investing!
