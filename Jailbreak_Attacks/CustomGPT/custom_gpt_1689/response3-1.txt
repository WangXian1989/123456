The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to help you make this decision:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Consider factors such as retirement age, lifestyle desires in retirement, and other financial objectives.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Each account type has different contribution limits and tax implications. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money first.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) and investments in taxable accounts have different tax treatments. Balance tax-advantaged accounts with taxable investments to optimize your tax situation in both the accumulation and withdrawal phases.

5. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Keep in mind that investments can be tax-efficient or tax-inefficient. For example, stocks that produce qualified dividends can be held in taxable accounts, while bonds that generate interest income may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your risk tolerance will guide how you allocate assets across accounts. Younger investors might focus more on growth investments, whereas those closer to retirement may prefer a conservative approach.

7. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By taking these steps into account, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your overall financial goals and tax situation.
