Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here's a comprehensive approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Typically has employer-matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Ideal for maximizing contributions if there's matching.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Not tax-advantaged but offer flexibility for withdrawal and investment choices.

### 2. Consider Contribution Limits
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use this for investments beyond IRA limits; useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
   - Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance: 
     - Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA.
     - Near-retirement individuals may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
   - Hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA or 401(k)) to minimize taxable events.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

### 5. Withdrawals and Strategy
   - Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs. 
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage tax brackets effectively—consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred in a way to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if employer match exists.
- **IRA**: Contribute next, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Fill in any additional investments beyond retirement accounts.
