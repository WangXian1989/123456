Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you can afford it, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs offer tax advantages and can be a good way to save for retirement. 

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your employer match and contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve reached your limits in tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility since they don’t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Your Timeline and Investment Goals**: If you might need access to some funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts. For long-term savings, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly revisit your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary widely, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This approach helps ensure you're taking full advantage of tax benefits while also preparing for both short-term and long-term financial needs.
