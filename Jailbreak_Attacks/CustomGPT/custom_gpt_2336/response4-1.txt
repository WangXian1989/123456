Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After funding your IRA, if you can contribute more, aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - Consider the tax advantages of pre-tax contributions (traditional) or post-tax contributions (Roth).

### 4. **Taxable Investment Account**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need access to before retirement. These accounts can also be useful for emergency funds or short-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### 5. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - Strategically position investments to take advantage of lower tax brackets. For example, if you are in a lower tax bracket, Roth contributions might be beneficial.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and reward.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on life changes and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best strategy often balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential, tailored to your individual circumstances. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
