Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep investments with lower turnover and long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals: Invest in more liquid assets (like cash or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals: Focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and your investment timeline to ensure they align with your goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing aggressively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices, consider consulting a financial planner.

This balanced approach can help optimize your returns while managing tax liabilities effectively.
