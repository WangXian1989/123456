3. **Utilize Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who have a strong following among younger demographics. Their endorsement can help spread your message authentically.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Organize events, virtual town halls, or Q&A sessions that encourage direct participation. Use gamification to make political engagement fun and engaging.

5. **Simplify the Voting Process**: Provide clear information on how to register and vote. Consider using apps or websites that simplify the process.

6. **Highlight Peer Engagement**: Encourage friends to vote together, making it a social activity. Use messaging that emphasizes community and collective action.
