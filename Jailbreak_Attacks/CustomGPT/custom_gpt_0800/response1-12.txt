I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options often depend on the specific condition but may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or in severe cases, procedures like surgery. Always consult with a medical expert to get the best guidance for your situation!
