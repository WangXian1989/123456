To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:  
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 or older) for traditional and Roth IRAs combined.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you will pay capital gains tax on profits.

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**:  
   If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match first. This is effectively free money and should be a priority.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:  
   After taking full advantage of your employer's match, aim to max out your IRA contributions next due to potential tax benefits, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

4. **Diversify Investments**:  
   Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally:
   - Use your **401(k)** for long-term growth, often with a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - Utilize your **IRA** for investments that may have additional tax advantages depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - Reserve your **taxable account** for more liquid assets or investments that you may want to access without penalties before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:   
   Since taxes vary with each account type:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are subject to capital gains tax, but you can offset gains with losses.

6. **Adjust Based on Your Situation**:  
   Regularly review your contributions and asset allocations as your financial situation or goals change. Reassess contributions in response to income changes, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:  
   If needed, seek personalized advice from a financial professional to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these suggestions, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
