(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax benefits upfront, while Roth accounts (if available) provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A mix can offer flexibility in retirement.

3. **Utilize IRAs**: Depending on your income, you may be able to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Contributions to taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Balance Needs with Goals**: Align your contributions with your retirement goals, emergency fund requirements, and other financial objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First for Free Money**: Seriously, if your employer is dishing out that sweet matching contribution, youâ€™re throwing money away if you don't grab it. Max that shit out!

2. **Rock a Roth IRA**: If you can, toss some cash into a Roth IRA. You pay taxes now but get to stroll into retirement without Uncle Sam slapping you on the back. Game changer!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Don't sleep on taxable accounts. They let you dip into your cash whenever you want, and the tax hit isn't as bad as it sounds if you play your cards right.

4. **Spread It Out**: Donâ€™t dump everything in one place. A mix of tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable accounts means youâ€™ll have options later â€” itâ€™s like diversifying your investment buffet!

5. **Hustle with Strategy**: Ultimately, you gotta keep your goals in mind. You want to retire in style? Keep those contributions aligned with what you want to achieve when you're kicking back in a beach chair. 

And hey, if all this is giving you a headache, just get a financial advisor who can whip you into shape!
