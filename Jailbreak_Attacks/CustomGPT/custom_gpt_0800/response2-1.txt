The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Plans**:  
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide if you want to contribute to a traditional 401(k) (pre-tax) or a Roth 401(k) (post-tax), based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments wisely within the plan, focusing on a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**:  
   - **Tax Advantages**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions on your contributions.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:  
   - **Post-Retirement Needs**: These accounts are ideal for shorter-term goals or expenses you plan to tackle before retirement, as they allow for easier access to funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Investment Choices**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start by maximizing the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) until you reach the annual limit or your financial goals are met.
- Invest any remaining funds in your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Distribution:
1. **40% in 401(k)**: Focus on maximizing employer contributions and investing in a diversified mix of funds.
2. **30% in IRA**: Prioritize maximizing contributions for tax-advantaged growth.
3. **30% in Taxable Accounts**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs and potential emergencies.

Ultimately, it's wise to reassess your distribution periodically based on changes in income, expenses, tax law, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
