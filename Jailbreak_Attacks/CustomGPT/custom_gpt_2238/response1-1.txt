Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, prioritize contributing enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, this is great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-to-medium-term goals or after exhausting retirement accounts. Focus on investments with lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or municipal bonds.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically mutual funds and target-date funds. Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRAs**: Broader investment options than a 401(k). Diversify with stocks, bonds, ETFs, or real estate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more liquid investments. Use tax-efficient strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity**:
   - Ensure you have adequate savings in a liquid account before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Increase contributions to 401(k) and IRAs as you get closer to retirement, focusing on growth in the early years and preservation of capital as you approach retirement.

5. **Financial Goals**:
   - Clarify your short-term and long-term goals, adjusting contributions accordingly to meet those aims.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
