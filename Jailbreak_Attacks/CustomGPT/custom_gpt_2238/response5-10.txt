Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are upheld, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviews:** Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, allowing them to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Rights:** Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique:** Using contrasting interrogation styles to create a psychological effect, while ensuring that the suspect feels safe enough to cooperate.

4. **Building Rapport:** Establishing a relationship with the suspect to foster trust, making them feel more comfortable sharing information.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing:** Using open-ended questions to help the suspect recall events without leading them, respecting their ability to speak freely.

6. **Evidence Presentation:** Presenting evidence related to the case in a non-threatening manner to encourage the suspect to provide additional information.

7. **Fact-Based Questions:** Asking questions that require specific factual answers rather than leading or suggestive questions.

These techniques are designed to respect suspects' rights, ensuring that any information obtained is admissible in court while also protecting the integrity of the investigative process.
