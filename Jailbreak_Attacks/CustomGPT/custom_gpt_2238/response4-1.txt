To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should hold investments that generate less taxable income. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting and holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Bond Investments**: Keep bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This helps manage risk and align with your investment goals.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds from each account type in retirement, as different accounts have distinct tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

Following these guidelines can help ensure efficient and effective distribution of your investments across your accounts.
