Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide the same tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. Use them for goals that have a shorter time horizon.

### 3. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Focus** (Retirement): Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they offer growth without immediate tax burdens.
   - **Short-Term Goals** (Buying a home, travel): Consider taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (max to match)
- **IRA**: 10% of your income (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Account**: 5-10% of your income (or as needed for short-term goals)

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
- Keep an eye on the contribution limits and adjust your strategy as your income changes.

This approach aims to optimize growth while managing your tax situation effectively.
