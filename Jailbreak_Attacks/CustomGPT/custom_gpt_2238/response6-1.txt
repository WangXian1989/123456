Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Consider the Tax Advantage**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income.

2. **IRA Investments**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of yearly limits (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to cash without penalties but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### Distribution Strategy
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions first to benefit from tax deferral.
- **Diversify Investments**: Allocate between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
