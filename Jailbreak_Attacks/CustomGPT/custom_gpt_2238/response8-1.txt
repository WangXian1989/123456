Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. This could mean keeping a portion of your money in taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for investments that may not be tax-efficient in retirement accounts (like real estate investment trusts or bonds).
   - Capital gains from investments held for over a year are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are far from retirement, you might lean slightly more toward growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment allocation is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of taxation and investment, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider capping contributions based on overall retirement savings goals.
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum if your income allows.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any excess cash flow after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for investments in taxable accounts.

Remember to revisit your distribution strategy periodically, especially as your circumstances change.
