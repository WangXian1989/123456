Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: High contribution limits compared to IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options**: Typically limited to a selection of funds chosen by the employer.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free, and withdrawals (under certain conditions) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold and may incur taxes on dividends and interest.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize the 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
- **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to your Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Distribution:
- For someone in their prime earning years:
  - 401(k): 15% of income (to max out the match)
  - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if eligible) per year
  - Taxable: Any remaining savings or investment amounts

Adjust your percentages based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor might also help personalize your strategy.
