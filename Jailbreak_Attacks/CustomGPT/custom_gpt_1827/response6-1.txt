To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Offers tax advantages, often with employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or grow tax-free (Roth IRA). Choose based on your current vs. future tax expectations.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments grow tax-efficiently, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance:** Determine your ability to take on risk. Higher-risk investments (stocks) may perform better over the long term, while lower-risk investments (bonds) provide stability.
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to manage risk.

### 3. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first; it’s free money.
- **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA next. The contribution limits are lower than a 401(k), but the growth potential is significant, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for extra savings once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA. Consider investments with lower capital gains impact (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

### 4. Tax Considerations
- **Tax Bracket Management:** Keep high-yield investments that generate taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts. Hold investments generating low yields or long-term growth in taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how to draw down these accounts in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Example Allocation:** 60% in 401(k), 20% in IRA, 20% in taxable accounts.
- **Reassess Regularly:** Monitor performance and adjust contributions based on market conditions, changes in income, or financial goals.

By understanding the strengths of each account type and strategically distributing your investments, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while managing risk and taxes.
