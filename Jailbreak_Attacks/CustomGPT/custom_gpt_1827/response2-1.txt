When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general framework that can guide your decisions:

### 1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000, plus an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Many 401(k) plans offer target-date funds, which can adjust the asset allocation as you approach retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts)**
   - **Types of IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed at contribution but tax-free upon withdrawal).
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those age 50+).
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maxing out a Roth IRA. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be better.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which usually generate fewer taxable events.
   - **Consideration for Short-term Needs:** If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, prioritize contributions here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  1. **Max out any employer match in your 401(k).**
  2. **Max out your IRA contributions.**
  3. **Return to your 401(k) and contribute more if you still have income to invest.**
  4. **Allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts.**

- **Rebalance Regularly:** As your investments grow, keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given individual circumstances, professional advice tailored to your financial situation can be invaluable.

This approach provides a balanced strategy to maximize your tax advantages and achieve your long-term financial goals.
