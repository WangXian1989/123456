Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match; that’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but make sure you meet the income limits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility, and they may be subject to capital gains taxes, but you can invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**:
   - If you're younger and can afford to take risks, consider a more aggressive portfolio in your retirement accounts since they have a long time to grow.
   - For taxable accounts, you might want to be more conservative, focusing on investments that generate low taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your overall strategy rather than by account type.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your financial priorities, whether that’s short-term liquidity, long-term growth, or retirement preparation.
