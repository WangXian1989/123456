Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and overall investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in your high-earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may benefit from a tax deduction with a Traditional IRA or tax-free withdrawals in retirement with a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Remember that IRA contributions have a lower limit compared to a 401(k). Make sure to utilize your IRA effectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:

- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in accessible funds.
- **Debt Management:** Pay off high-interest debts before investing aggressively.
- **Retirement Accounts First:** Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's a company match, then contribute to an IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts Last:** Use after maximizing retirement accounts for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth.

### Rebalance and Adjust:
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment goals.

### Consult a Professional:
- It's always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially concerning tax implications and investment strategies. 

This balanced approach will help you build a diversified portfolio while maximizing your tax advantages.
