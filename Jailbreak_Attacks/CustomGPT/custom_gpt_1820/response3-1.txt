When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions in certain income brackets, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) can be beneficial, as it reduces your taxable income now.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA might be advantageous because you'll pay taxes now at a lower rate, and withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Once you've taken advantage of your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This provides flexibility with withdrawals and access to funds if needed.

4. **Invest According to Goals:**
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments that you may want to access before retirement.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Allocation:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement might shift towards bonds and fixed income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial professional for personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation, especially if managing taxes and investment choices becomes complex.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals and optimize for tax efficiency.
