Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and overall financial situation. Here are some general strategies to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can, as these funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions but taxes are owed on withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Hold investments that generate ordinary income, such as bonds and REITs, as these will benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. 

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Equities**: Suitable for all account types due to potential for growth. 
   - **Fixed Income/Bonds**: Consider keeping these in tax-deferred accounts for tax-efficiency.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Future Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to manage your tax bracket effectively.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might favor aggressive growth strategies in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might lean towards preservation of capital.
- **State Taxes**: Consider your state tax situation, as it may affect which account types make the most sense for your investment strategy.

By carefully considering each of these factors, you can create a well-rounded and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your personal financial goals.
