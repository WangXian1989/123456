To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After securing the match, consider putting more money into your IRA (if eligible) or your 401(k), as these accounts have significant tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be more accessible for short-term needs and emergencies, so consider allocating money here after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Align your distributions with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Longer-term goals can be funded through retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type, such as withdrawals, capital gains, and contributions.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**: If unsure about the best allocation, consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

Always reassess your allocations periodically to adapt to changes in your financial situation and goals.
