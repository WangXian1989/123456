The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. For many, a Roth IRA is attractive due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Taxation:** Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends that are taxed at lower rates. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual needs.
