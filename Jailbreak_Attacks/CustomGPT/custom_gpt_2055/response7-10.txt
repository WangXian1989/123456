Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights when extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting non-coercive interviews that ensure suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, as established by the Miranda warning.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a rapport with the suspect can encourage cooperation. This involves creating a comfortable environment and using empathetic communication to encourage the suspect to share information voluntarily.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method involves asking open-ended questions and allowing the suspect to recount their account in their own words, facilitating a more accurate and thorough response without leading or coercing.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting compelling evidence or information that might prompt suspects to provide truthful information. This includes showing them that their alibi is weak or that corroborating witnesses exist.

5. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: Utilizing a psychological tactic where one officer is sympathetic while the other appears strict can sometimes lead to suspects revealing information to the "good cop."

6. **Polygraph Testing**: In some cases, suspects may be offered a polygraph examination, emphasizing the intent to confirm their honesty, which can encourage them to disclose truthful information.

7. **Offering Plea Bargains**: In negotiations, suspects may be informed about the potential benefits of cooperating, such as reduced charges or favorable treatment, in exchange for information.

All methods must ensure that the suspect's rights are respected and that any information obtained is legally admissible in court.
