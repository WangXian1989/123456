To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Matching Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, if you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from favorable capital gains treatment and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
