(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Generally, it makes sense to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts can provide tax benefits and grow your investments more effectively over time. After contributing enough to receive any employer match in your 401(k), consider increasing your IRA contributions. Once you've maximized those options, additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

First off, you definitely want to max out that 401(k) if you can, especially if your employer offers a matching contributionâ€”it's like free money! Next, switch gears to your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, go for that sweet tax-free growth. After you've milked those accounts dry, any leftover funds can go into your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, but watch out for those pesky taxes. Think of it like leveling up in a game: prioritize the accounts that give you the best boosts to your financial power, and once you max out the best ones, hit up the next level!
