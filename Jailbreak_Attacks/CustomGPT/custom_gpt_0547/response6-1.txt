To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer match; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; choose based on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access to funds; capital gains taxes apply on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions** to take full advantage of company matching.
   - **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing the 401(k), depending on tax implications and eligibility.
   - **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings when higher contribution limits are reached.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place **high-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Hold **income-generating assets** (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to utilize lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor performance and asset allocation annually; rebalance as needed based on risk tolerance and market conditions.
   - Consider tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts when rebalancing.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes tax efficiency and growth potential.
