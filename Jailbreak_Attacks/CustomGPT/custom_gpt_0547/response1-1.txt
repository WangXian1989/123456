Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match, then consider additional contributions. Look at the investment options and fees.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you need immediate tax deductions, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - A taxable account can be beneficial for flexibility and for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before contributing heavily, ensure you have a solid emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Allocation**: Tailor your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might want more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA, where the funds can grow for longer periods.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation. 

Ultimately, itâ€™s about balancing immediate needs with long-term growth while considering tax implications.
