To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it has low fees and good investment options.
   - **Traditional IRA:** This account can also provide tax deductions for contributions, depending on your income and filing status.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxation:** 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you plan to access before retirement. Since they are taxed differently (capital gains taxes), they can be a flexible option for shorter-term goals.

4. **Investment Diversification:** Ensure that your investment choices within these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your overall financial goals.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs:** Assess how much you need in the short term (which could influence taxable accounts) versus what you can afford to lock away for longer periods (like in retirement accounts).

Consulting with a financial advisor could further tailor this advice to your specific financial situation.
