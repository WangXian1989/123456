Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if you can, typically up to $22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account.
   - This is suitable for more liquid investments or for funds you may need before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Consider your overall tax situation: investments that generate high income (like bonds or REITs) may be better in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Think about your retirement goals and adjust contributions based on when you'll need the money.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
