(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This account can provide additional tax advantages, depending on your income level.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds beyond tax-advantaged accounts can be directed to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, although they come with tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a reasonable asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
