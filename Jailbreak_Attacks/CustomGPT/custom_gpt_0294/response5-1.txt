(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA (if eligible). This is essential for maximizing tax-free growth.

2. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts are less tax-efficient due to capital gains tax on investments. Aim to hold investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Prioritize retirement accounts**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts. This strategy helps leverage tax-deferred growth.

4. **Assess asset allocation**: Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Place more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: As your investments grow, rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! When it comes to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s the gist:

1. **401(k) - Free money alert**: First off, if your employer offers a match, max that bad boy out! It's free cash and can significantly boost your retirement fund.

2. **IRA - Tax advantages galore**: Depending on your eligibility, throw as much as you can into a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). It's all about leveraging those tax breaks.

3. **Taxable accounts - Go slow, pal**: Only pump money into taxable accounts after you've squeezed the max out of your 401(k) and IRA. Invest in index funds or ETFs for lower capital gains when you inevitably sell.

4. **Diversify wisely**: Make sure you're diversifying across all your accounts, but keep your higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts to avoid taxes on those gains until retirement. 

5. **Rebalance like a boss**: Regularly check your asset allocation. You want to stay in line with your risk comfort zone; donâ€™t let any one account throw you off course!

Your financial situation is unique, so consider chatting with a pro for the best strategy tailored to you.
