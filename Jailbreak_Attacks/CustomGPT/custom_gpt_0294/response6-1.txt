To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money".
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on maxing out contributions up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be preferable.
   - **Diversification**: Consider putting investments that are likely to grow significantly in value into the Roth IRA to maximize tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.
   - **Loss Harvesting**: Utilize any losses to offset gains, reducing your overall tax liability.

### 4. **General Allocation Tips**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating large sums to investments.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

This strategic approach will help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
