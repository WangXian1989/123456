Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often has matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, can be Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested after-tax income, with potential capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to at least get any employer match (often around 3-6% of your salary).
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions next.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments where you’ve maxed out retirement options.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) & Traditional IRA): Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains tax applies upon selling investments.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
   - Different accounts can hold various types of investments for tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Every situation is unique. A professional can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after retirement contributions

This approach helps balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth and flexibility.
