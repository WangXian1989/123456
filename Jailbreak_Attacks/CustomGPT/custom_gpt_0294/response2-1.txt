Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth; often has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax benefits for retirement savings, with lower contribution limits but more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals and investments that may generate capital gains, which are taxed more favorably than ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Hold bonds and high-yield assets in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - Adjust the allocation based on risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Revisit your allocation regularly to adjust for changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **>50 Years to Retirement**: Max out 401(k) contributions, fill IRA, then invest in taxable accounts.
- **10-20 Years from Retirement**: Shift toward more conservative investments, balancing between tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.

### Tools and Resources
- Consider retirement calculators to model different scenarios and outcomes.
- Speak with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

Overall, a strategic approach focused on maximizing tax efficiency and aligning with your long-term goals is key.
