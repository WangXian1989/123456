Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider your income level for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Good for assets with high expected growth (like stocks) since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Best for accounts you expect to grow a lot since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. Consider holding bonds or high-yield stocks here for tax efficiency.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Lean towards more aggressive growth assets in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid, conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations as needed based on performance, contribution changes, and shifts in your financial situation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 20-30% of your total savings.
- **IRA:** 10-20%.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder based on your goals and liquidity needs.

### Final Thoughts
Tailor your strategy based on personal goals, risk tolerance, and consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
