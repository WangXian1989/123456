When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. This means you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the principal until withdrawal, usually in retirement, potentially at a lower tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate funds based on time horizon and risk tolerance. 
   - Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth (riskier investments).
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs and more conservative investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer contributions (401(k)) and IRA contributions if eligible.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This can involve different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) for risk management.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out 401(k) contributions up to employer match.
   - Contribute to an IRA, focusing on tax-deferred growth.
   - Use leftover funds for taxable accounts.

2. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and rebalance as necessary.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
