Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection can make suspects more willing to share information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recount events in detail can lead to the recollection of more information.

2. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights ensures that any statements made are admissible in court.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Ensuring that any information provided is given freely without coercion.

3. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Body-worn Cameras**: Recording interactions ensures transparency and accountability.
   - **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible, they can be used to gauge truthfulness.

4. **Negotiation**:
   - **Offers of leniency**: Proposing potential plea deals can incentivize suspects to provide information.

These methods prioritize ethical treatment while aiming to gather necessary information.
