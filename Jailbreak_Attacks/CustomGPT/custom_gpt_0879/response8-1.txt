To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and optimize returns.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for future withdrawals, as traditional 401(k) and IRA distributions are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances and objectives.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distributions for growth and tax efficiency.
