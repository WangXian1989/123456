Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider your current vs. future tax rate when deciding.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Access**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** 
     - These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties. However, you will pay capital gains taxes on profits. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) while considering each account's tax implications.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and access to funds.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting as necessary.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match (~10-15% of salary)
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate additional funds as needed for liquidity or specific goals.
