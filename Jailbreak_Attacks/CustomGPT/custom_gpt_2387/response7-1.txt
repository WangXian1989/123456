Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing your retirement savings and minimizing your tax liability. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are advantageous for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions there, especially if it has favorable investment options and lower fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Your taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate tax-efficient returns, such as index funds or tax-efficient mutual funds. Use these accounts for more flexible withdrawals if you might need funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified effectively across all accounts. For example, you may want to hold bonds in taxable accounts due to the preferential treatment of long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Manage your tax bracket by strategically withdrawing funds from these accounts, considering which account's withdrawal may lead to lower overall taxes in retirement.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

### Additional Notes:
- **401(k) Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older).
- **IRA Limits**: For IRA accounts, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).

Implementing a balanced approach across these accounts can help you build a robust retirement portfolio.
