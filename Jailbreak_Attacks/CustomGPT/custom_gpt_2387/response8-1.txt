The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, with the potential for tax deductions depending on your income level and participation in an employer plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing qualified withdrawals to be tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals. They can be useful for short-term goals or as part of a broader investment strategy.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize immediate tax liability.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds during retirement. Each account has different tax implications on withdrawals, affecting your overall tax strategy.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and reallocate funds as necessary to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

It’s essential to evaluate your personal circumstances and adjust your strategy over time as your financial situation and goals evolve.
