Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline that you might consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Enough for Tax Benefits**: The contributions you make to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, which can decrease your taxable income. Aim to maximize contributions if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your current and future tax situations when deciding between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If you're eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages and compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Contributions to taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as 401(k)s or IRAs, but they offer more flexibility in terms of access to funds. Consider keeping money in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or municipal bonds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **General Strategies**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance if necessary to maintain your target asset allocation.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type when making withdrawals or selling investments. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal finance is complex, and you might benefit from speaking with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance while making these decisions.
