When determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling appreciated assets, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Assess your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Longer horizons can typically take on more risk in growth-oriented investments.

### Strategic Distribution Approach
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match â€” this is essentially "free money."
  - Once the match is secured, consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation).
  
- **Balance Between Accounts**:
  - After maxing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to a **taxable account** for flexibility and access before retirement.

- **Consider Asset Location**:
  - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
  - Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts if they are expected to have lower turnover, minimizing capital gains taxes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Aim for at least the maximum employer match plus 10%-15% of your income.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing retirement accounts can go here for flexibility.

By considering these factors and strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes throughout your investment journey.
