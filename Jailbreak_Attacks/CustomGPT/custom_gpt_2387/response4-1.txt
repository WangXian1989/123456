Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you’re maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you may incur capital gains taxes).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your overall asset allocation strategy across all accounts. Different accounts may have different tax implications for the investments within them. For instance, it might be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Periodically review your distribution and asset allocation to ensure they align with your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Remember to adjust these strategies as your financial situation changes, and consider your long-term financial goals when making decisions about distributing your money.
