Law enforcement officials have a variety of methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some common techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection can make suspects more willing to divulge information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking open-ended questions to help witnesses or suspects recall details without leading them.

2. **Search and Seizure Procedures**:
   - **Warrants**: Obtaining a warrant based on probable cause allows law enforcement to search property legally.
   - **Plain View Doctrine**: If officers are legally present and see evidence of a crime, they can seize it without a warrant.

3. **Miranda Rights**:
   - **Informing Suspects**: Before interrogation, suspects must be informed of their rights, allowing them to understand that they can remain silent and that anything said can be used against them.

4. **Polygraph Testing**:
   - **Voluntary Participation**: If a suspect agrees, polygraph tests can be used as a tool to gauge the truthfulness of their statements.

These methods aim to gather information while upholding the legal rights of individuals, ensuring that any evidence obtained is admissible in court.
