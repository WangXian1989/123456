(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount annually.
  
2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, contribute to this account next. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can give you a tax deduction in the year you contribute.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

Reviewing your overall financial plan with a financial advisor can help tailor this distribution to your specific situation.
