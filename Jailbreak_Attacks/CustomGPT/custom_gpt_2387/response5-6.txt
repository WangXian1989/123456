Young voters are significantly active on social media platforms, so utilizing targeted ads, influencers, and engaging content can help reach them effectively. Additionally, issues that resonate with them, such as climate change, education, and social justice, should be at the forefront of the campaignâ€™s messaging.

Think TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, where you can create viral content that speaks to their experiences and values. Plus, teaming up with influencers who can do the heavy lifting for you will totally amplify your message. Don't just toss out dry policy talk; get real and relatable. Talk about stuff that keeps them up at night: student debt, climate chaos, and social issues that matter. And remember, humor and authenticity go a long way! Don't just aim to informâ€”aim to connect and rally them to make some noise!
