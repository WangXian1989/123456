To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the annual limit, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to utilize the tax advantages, but be aware of income limits.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):**
     - Focus on allocating higher-growth investments here (e.g., stocks) to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):**
     - Use for long-term investments to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Hold less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - Younger investors might skew more towards equities in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may prefer fixed income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure you maintain adequate liquid savings (not in retirement accounts) for emergencies before maximizing retirement contributions.

Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.
