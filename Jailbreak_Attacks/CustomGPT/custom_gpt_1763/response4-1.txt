To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first to benefit from tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Selection**:
   - **Higher-Interest Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place investments with high expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for low-return investments (like bonds).

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay informed about annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs to maximize savings.

4. **Income Needs**:
   - Plan your withdrawals and distributions based on future income needs, with taxable accounts offering more flexibility without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contribution strategy based on performance, tax laws, and your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
