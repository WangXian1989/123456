When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks), as long-term gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better housed in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter them from taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Prioritize withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional advice can be valuable for tailored strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy and enhance your long-term financial growth.
