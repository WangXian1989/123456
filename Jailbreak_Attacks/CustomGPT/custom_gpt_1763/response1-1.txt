Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if there's a match. Consider choosing a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only use taxable accounts for additional savings after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across your accounts to manage risk and optimize growth.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax bracket at retirement. If you expect it to be higher, focus more on Roth accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing life circumstances, and financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider your unique financial situation and goals before making investment decisions.
