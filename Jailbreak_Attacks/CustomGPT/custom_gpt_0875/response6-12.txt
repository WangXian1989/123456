Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition, but it may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintaining a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
   - Avoiding alcohol and minimizing intake of processed foods.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, specific medications may be prescribed. 

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests with your doctor could be critical.

Please seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
