The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions if you expect to be in a lower bracket when you retire.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions (if eligible), go back to your 401(k) to increase contributions. In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible, allowing access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are spread across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that your overall allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific concerns or complex financial situations, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This strategy provides a balance of tax advantages and growth potential while accommodating future liquidity needs. Always adjust based on your personal circumstances.
