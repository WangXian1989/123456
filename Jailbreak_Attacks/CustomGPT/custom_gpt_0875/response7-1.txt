The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Max out any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute as much as you can, ideally up to the IRS contribution limit if you can afford it. 
   - Invest in a diversified mix of asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (income limits apply), as withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free.
   - If you're eligible, prioritize getting the maximum contribution to your IRA after the 401(k) match.
   - Diversify your investments in an IRA similarly to a 401(k), focusing on long-term growth assets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider a brokerage account for additional investments.
   - Use a taxable account for investments that are less tax-efficient (e.g., stocks that qualify for long-term capital gains).
   - Keep some cash reserves for emergency funds or short-term goals.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
- Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.
- Consider your tax bracket and aim for a balance that minimizes tax implications while focusing on growth.

**Conclusion**:
Ultimately, the best allocation depends on your individual situation, so consulting with a financial advisor or tax professional can provide tailored guidance.
