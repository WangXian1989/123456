To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as the 401(k) if you qualify for deductions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Itâ€™s best for keeping liquid investments.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Long-term Investments**: Consider holding stocks and equity funds in accounts like your Roth IRA and taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
   - **Bonds and Fixed Income**: They are generally better suited for tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) or traditional IRAs to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid assets in a separate savings account for emergencies before putting all your money into retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to mitigate risk.

6. **Ongoing Contributions**: Regularly contribute to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

Lastly, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
