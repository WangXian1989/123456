Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Assess Contribution Limits and Benefits:
- **401(k):**
  - High contribution limits (up to $22,500 for 2023).
  - Employer match (if available) is free money; maximize contributions to benefit from this.
  
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
  - Lower contribution limits (up to $6,500 for 2023).
  - Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals; consider based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. Tax Efficiency:
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA):**
  - Place assets with higher expected returns (like stock funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Use for investments that generate lower tax impacts (like municipal bonds) and for saving for short-term goals.
  - Be mindful of capital gains and dividend taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** next, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
- Any additional savings can go into a **taxable account** for liquidity and flexibility, especially for short-term needs.

### Next Steps:
- **Reassess Annually:** Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.
- **Consider Professional Advice:** Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distributions in a way that aligns with your financial objectives.
