To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; employer matching contributions can enhance returns.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They donâ€™t have tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on investments that might produce higher taxable income if held in a taxable account (e.g., bonds) to take full advantage of tax deferral.
   - For taxable accounts, consider holding investments that appreciate in value rather than produce income (like stocks), as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts by including different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Over time, the distribution may shift due to asset performance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance will influence how aggressively you should invest in different accounts.

7. **Plan for Early Withdrawals**:
   - If you might need access to funds before retirement, focus on your taxable accounts and consider minimizing withdrawals from retirement accounts to avoid penalties and taxes.

As you are planning this distribution, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial goals and tax situation.
