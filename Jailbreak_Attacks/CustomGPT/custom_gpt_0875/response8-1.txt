The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out (or if you cannot contribute to an IRA due to income limits), focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This option provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you'll have to pay taxes on any gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

6. **Monitor Your Tax Situation**: Adjust your distribution strategy based on your current and expected future tax rates. Tax planning is crucial for optimizing your investment returns.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that individual circumstances can greatly vary, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

Always consider factors like your retirement age, expected spending, and any changes in tax laws.
