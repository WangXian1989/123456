I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the issue, so itâ€™s essential to get a proper diagnosis first. Here are a few general options that may be considered:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may help manage symptoms or address specific conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function and progression of the disease are important.

4. **Invasive Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsies or surgeries may be necessary to address significant issues.

Please see a healthcare provider for more specific recommendations tailored to your situation.
