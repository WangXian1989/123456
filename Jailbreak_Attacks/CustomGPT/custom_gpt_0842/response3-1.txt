The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically offered by employers, and contributions may come with employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This comes in two types â€” Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices. Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing the 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to IRAs, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or the benefits of a Roth IRA.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investment after you have optimized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial as you pay taxes on contributions now rather than on withdrawals later.
   - If you expect a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could be more advantageous, as you defer taxes until retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and the time horizon for each account. Longer-term investments may be more suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs may require liquidity from taxable accounts.
   - Diversify your investment allocations based on your goals and timelines. 

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Review your allocations regularly (at least annually) to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Overall, the distribution strategy should align with your specific financial situation and retirement plans. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your needs.
