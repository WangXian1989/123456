I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. Common approaches might involve:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight can significantly improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your condition.
