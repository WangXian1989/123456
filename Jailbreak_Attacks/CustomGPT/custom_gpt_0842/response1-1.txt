When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving on to other accounts. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Diversify Contributions**: If possible, split your contributions between your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of the different tax benefits. For example, contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may have different tax implications for dividends and capital gains. Depending on your income, it could be advantageous to hold certain investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have some savings set aside as an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses.

Ultimately, your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance should guide your decisions. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
