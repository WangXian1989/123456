Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the maximum is $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re younger, you might opt for more aggressive investments in stocks within your 401(k) and IRA, while balancing with safer investments in taxable accounts as you approach retirement.

5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens, while keeping tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best strategy, so consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation.

By balancing these factors, you can create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
