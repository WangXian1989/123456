Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). 
   - Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. Choose these for higher current income.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline and tax strategy. Younger individuals may prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free growth, while those closer to retirement might favor traditional accounts for tax savings now.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account, ensure you’re diversifying your investments to minimize risk and potentially improve returns.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation as your income, tax situation, and goals change.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional savings for flexibility.
