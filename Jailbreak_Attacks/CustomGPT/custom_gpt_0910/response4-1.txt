Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute at least enough to earn the full match. If possible, increase your contributions over time, especially as you receive raises.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are ideal for money you might need before retirement. They may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.
  
4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly evaluate and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Consider having a few months’ worth of expenses saved in a high-interest savings account before heavily investing.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
