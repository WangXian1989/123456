Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Typically, prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; however, distributions are taxed as ordinary income. Consider placing higher-growth investments with the potential for higher returns here.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s in that contributions are tax-deductible and distributions are taxed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a good option for investments expected to grow significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover, tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs. This can reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before making significant contributions to these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing more volatile investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on any potential gains.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. A strategic withdrawal plan can help minimize taxes.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
