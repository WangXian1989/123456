Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments meant for short-term gains or that generate income (like dividends) which may be taxed at favorable rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Options**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance in all account types.

### 4. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on changing income, market conditions, and retirement timeline as circumstances evolve.

By strategically distributing your assets, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
