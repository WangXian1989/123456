To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This account lowers your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for investments with lower capital gains distributions and can provide liquidity for short-term goals.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level. This is crucial as different accounts may grow at different rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Knowing when you'll need money can influence how you allocate assets today.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary, so getting tailored advice from a professional can provide significant value.

By structuring your investments this way, you can maximize tax efficiency and support your long-term financial goals.
