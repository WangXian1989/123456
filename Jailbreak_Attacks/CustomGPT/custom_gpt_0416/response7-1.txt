Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Traditional contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. This is particularly useful for shorter-term goals where you may need access to the funds.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Generally, more aggressive investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts to limit tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. 

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
