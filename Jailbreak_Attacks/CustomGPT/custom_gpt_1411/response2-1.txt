Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund Your IRA:**
   - Consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are often preferable for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement due to tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):**
   - After maxing out the IRA, continue maxing out your 401(k) contributions to further reduce taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts, where interest is taxable.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### General Approach:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have some liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debts before aggressive investing.

This general strategy should be tailored to your specific situation, possibly with the help of a financial advisor.
