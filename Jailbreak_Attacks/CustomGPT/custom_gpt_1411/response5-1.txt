To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions to get any employer match. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Roth or traditional IRA, consider contributing to a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Choose a diverse range of assets in each account. For example, consider higher-risk growth stocks in your taxable accounts for tax efficiency and bond funds in your 401(k) or IRA for long-term growth.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your investment choices within each account with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Longer-term investments can go into tax-advantaged accounts, while those needed soon can be kept in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments according to market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that fit your specific circumstances.
