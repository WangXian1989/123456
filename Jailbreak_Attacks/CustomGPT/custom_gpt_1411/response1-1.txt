Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after maxing out your IRA. The contribution limits are higher for 401(k)s compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term gains might be taxed at a lower rate. They are also more flexible for withdrawals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid savings before heavily investing.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from each type of account in retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
