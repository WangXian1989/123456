To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that limit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Evaluate your tax situation to choose the best option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility and no contribution limits, but investment gains are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, ensuring you manage risks and align with your financial goals.
   - Consider asset location strategies, placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and equities in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and market performance.
   - Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term financial growth.
