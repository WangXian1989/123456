Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maxed your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but eligibility phases out at higher incomes.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, typically in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when deciding on the allocation.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance through regular rebalancing, which involves selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones to maintain your desired mix.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer, then move to tax-deferred accounts, and finally access Roth accounts for tax-free income.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation, ensuring you're making the most informed decisions for your future.
