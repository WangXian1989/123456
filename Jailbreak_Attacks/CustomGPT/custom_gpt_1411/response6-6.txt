   - Utilize interactive activities (like Q&A sessions with candidates) to foster a sense of community and involvement.

4. **Simplify the Voting Process:**
   - Provide clear information about registration and voting procedures to reduce barriers.
   - Use technology, such as apps or websites, to facilitate easy registration and access to polling locations.
