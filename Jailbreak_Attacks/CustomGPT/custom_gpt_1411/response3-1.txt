Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a guide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are pre-tax; Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep liquidity in taxable accounts.
   - **Retirement Savings:** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA, especially if there's an employer match.

### 3. **Balance Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **Utilize IRAs:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs are preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or when you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Prioritize 401(k) and IRAs for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for funds you may need sooner, as withdrawals may incur capital gains tax.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Tailor your investment strategy based on your comfort level and timeline.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - **Monitor Performance:** Regularly assess your account performance and adjust contributions or allocations as needed.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your intended asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Fully fund your IRA (if eligible) annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first while maintaining liquidity for immediate needs, is key to effective money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
