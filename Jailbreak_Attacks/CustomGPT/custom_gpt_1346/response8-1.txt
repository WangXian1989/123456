The optimal distribution of your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to max out contributions if possible, given the tax-deferred growth advantages.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility, though they won’t have the same tax benefits. Consider investing in assets that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and History**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to support growth while managing risk. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on performance and your changing financial situation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.

Always remember to consider your long-term financial goals and consult with professionals if you’re unsure about your choices.
