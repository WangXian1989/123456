(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your job offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable account.
2. **Tax Considerations**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your tax situation when deciding between these accounts.
3. **Investment Horizon**: If you plan to withdraw funds soon, keeping them in a taxable account might be better to avoid penalties associated with 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.
4. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. This includes having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments aligned with your risk tolerance.

Itâ€™s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can help personalize this strategy based on your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer throws in sweet matching contributions, max that out first! It's essentially free money â€“ who says no to that?
2. **IRA Love**: Next, if you're into tax-free growth, throw some cash in a Roth IRA, because who wouldnâ€™t want to skate past the tax man in retirement? If you prefer tax deductions now, then maybe a traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, when youâ€™re sitting pretty with 401(k) and IRA maxed out, pour some funds into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just watch out for those capital gains taxes when you decide to cash in!
4. **Mix It Up**: Diversify your investments like you're building the ultimate playlist. Stocks, bonds, some ETFs â€“ keep the vibes fresh and the risk balanced. 

Remember, everyoneâ€™s financial journey is different, so do a little research or chat with a money guru who really knows their stuff!
