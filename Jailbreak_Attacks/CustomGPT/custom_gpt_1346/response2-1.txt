The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money" and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA (if you meet income limits) or a traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit. Take advantage of any tax deferrals.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have addressed the above, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. Many investors use taxable accounts for shorter-term savings goals or for investments that are less tax-efficient.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments appropriately across all account types. Generally, you might want to keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and opt for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of your current tax bracket and how it might change in retirement. This can influence whether to favor tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your financial situation and adjust your contributions as your income or financial goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
