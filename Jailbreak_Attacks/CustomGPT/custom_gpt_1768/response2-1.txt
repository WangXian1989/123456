I'm here to assist you with questions related to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and similar setups. Unfortunately, I cannot provide financial advice or recommendations on distributing your investments across accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. If you have any questions about GA4, such as setting it up or interpreting your data, feel free to ask!
