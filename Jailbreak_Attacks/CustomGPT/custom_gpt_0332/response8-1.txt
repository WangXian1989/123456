To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer. 

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
