Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out employer match if available.
   - Prioritize contributions to balance tax advantages.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds.
   - Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategies**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly adjust your investments to maintain your desired allocation.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for immediate needs.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your plan based on your financial situation and retirement goals.
