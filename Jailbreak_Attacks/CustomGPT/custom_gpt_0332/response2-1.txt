Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk levels and investment goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
