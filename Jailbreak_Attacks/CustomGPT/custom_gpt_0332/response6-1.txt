Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Account**: Use for short-term goals and investments that generate capital gains or interest since these can be taxed more heavily.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Invest more in bonds or high-yield investments here to defer taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Different accounts can hold different types of investments based on tax implications.
   - **Rebalancing Strategy**: Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks.
   - **Short-Term**: Keep safer assets in taxable accounts to access funds without penalties.

### Implementation Strategy
- Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.
- Allocate excess funds to a taxable account, ensuring liquidity for short-term needs.

### Review Regularly
- Reevaluate your strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

By following these principles, you can create a well-balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
