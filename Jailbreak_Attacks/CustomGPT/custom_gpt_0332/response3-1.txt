Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize these accounts for long-term savings due to their tax benefits. Max out your IRA if you can contribute to it, especially if it's a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth).
   - **Health Savings Accounts (HSA)**: If eligible, consider contributing to an HSA for additional tax advantages.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an easily accessible emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments like index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient, as they typically generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Adjust your asset allocation based on the type of account:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: For your 401(k) and traditional IRA, consider holding investments that may generate significant income, as taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate assets that are more favorable from a tax perspective (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can strategically distribute your money to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
