Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA next. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or for broader investment choices. Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Allocate based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented assets in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may want stability and income through bonds.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before tying up too much money in retirement accounts or investments.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Reevaluate your distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
