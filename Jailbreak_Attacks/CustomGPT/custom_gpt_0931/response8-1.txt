When distributing your funds among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to both a traditional and a Roth IRA. The limits for 2024 are $6,500 per account or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for high-income years to lower your taxable income. Withdraw from these accounts in retirement when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.
   - Use Roth IRAs strategically for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account, as you can access these funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Location**: 
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy carefully, balancing needs and tax implications. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first before touching tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your income, taxes, and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can work towards optimizing your retirement savings and investments across different account types effectively.
