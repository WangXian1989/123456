(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions to maximize tax-deferred growth. 

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) can provide tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce taxable income, such as stocks expected to appreciate in the long run or for short-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs.

A balanced strategy might involve contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, funding an IRA, and only then filling a taxable account based on your overall investment strategy and liquidity needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down like this: youâ€™ve got your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accountsâ€”each one serves a different purpose, and you can leverage them like a financial mastermind!

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer has a match, you damn well better take that free cash! Aim to hit that max contribution limit; it's like getting a sweet deal on your future self. The more you stash away now, the more it grows, tax-deferred!

2. **IRA**: Next, look into IRAs. If you're going the Traditional route, remember that tax deduction gameâ€”sweet! But if youâ€™re feeling bold, a Roth IRA lets you pull funds tax-free later on. It's like paying taxes now to avoid a much bigger bill down the line. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: And finally, for those nifty taxable accounts, use them for the stuff that doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere. Think about stocks youâ€™ll hold long-term for that sweet capital gains treatment. Plus, you can use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains. 

Honestly, spread the cash around based on your goals and timelines! Mix it up, play the field, and make your money work as hard as you do!
