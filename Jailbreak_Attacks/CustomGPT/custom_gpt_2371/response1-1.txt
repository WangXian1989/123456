Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic way to maximize your investment benefits. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide how to allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type

**401(k) Accounts:** 
These are employer-sponsored retirement plans that often come with matching contributions. This means if your employer matches contributions up to a certain percentage, it's essentially free money—don't skip out on it!

**IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts):**
IRAs offer tax advantages to help you save for retirement. There are two main types: Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs let your contributions grow tax-free if you meet certain conditions.

**Taxable Accounts:**
This is where you invest money without the tax advantages of retirement accounts. You pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Assess Your Financial Goals

What are your short-term and long-term financial goals? Are you looking for growth, preservation, or a mix? Understanding your objectives will help you decide how to allocate your money across these accounts.

### 3. Allocate by Priority and Tax Efficiency

**Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the match—this is your first priority. If you can, try to max out your contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500).
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA next. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.

**Invest in Taxable Accounts After:**
Once you've maximized the tax-advantaged options, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you access to funds without early withdrawal penalties, aiding your financial flexibility.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust

Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review and adjust your allocation accordingly. It’s wise to rebalance your portfolio annually or after significant life changes.

### Conclusion

Finding the right balance for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can take some thought, but prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while keeping an eye on your financial goals is an excellent starting point. 

### Actionable Takeaways
