Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a key strategy in building long-term wealth and optimizing your tax situation. Here’s a guide to help you make the most of each type of account:

### Understanding Each Account

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **What it is**: An employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows you to save for retirement with tax advantages.
   - **Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), and many employers offer matching contributions.
   - **Considerations**: Investment choices may be limited to those offered by your employer, and withdrawals before age 59½ can incur penalties.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **What it is**: A personal retirement savings account that offers tax benefits.
   - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Benefits**: Greater control over investments compared to a 401(k) and flexible withdrawal options (particularly with a Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **What it is**: Regular investment accounts without the tax advantages of retirement accounts.
   - **Benefits**: Access to funds at any time without penalties, capital gains taxes apply only upon selling investments for profit.
   - **Considerations**: You will need to manage tax liability from any dividends and capital gains.

### Strategic Distribution of Funds

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs are excellent for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your retirement accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This is particularly useful for funds that you may need before retirement or for short-term goals.

### Assessing Your Individual Goals

- **Time Horizon**: If you are young and have a long time until retirement, you might favor aggressive growth in your taxable account or IRA. Conversely, if retirement is around the corner, you might look to stabilize your investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Consider how comfortable you are with risk. Retirement accounts might be more heavily invested in stocks, while your taxable account could include safer options.

### Actionable Tips

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
- **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In your taxable account, consider selling losing investments to offset gains and reduce taxable income.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with tax laws and contribution limits as they can change from year to year.

### Conclusion

Balancing your contributions among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing your savings strategy. Put focus on employer matches, evaluate your retirement goals, and tailor your investments accordingly. 

### Questions to Consider 

1. What is your current age and retirement timeline? How does that impact your investment strategy?
2. Have you considered your risk tolerance and how that affects your investment choices across different accounts?
3. Do you have specific financial goals outside of retirement that you are planning for?
