I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can vary greatly, and treatment options often depend on the specific condition and its severity. Generally, treatment might include lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. For more severe conditions, medications or even surgery may be necessary. Consulting with a healthcare professional who can diagnose the condition accurately and propose a personalized treatment plan is essential.

If you have access to a healthcare provider, theyâ€™ll be able to guide you toward the best treatment options based on your medical history and specific liver issue. Always prioritize opening a dialogue with a medical professional for your health concerns.
