It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Depending on your specific liver condition, treatment options may vary. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes, medications, or medical procedures tailored to the type of liver issue you have (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Always prioritize professional guidance for the best outcomes.
