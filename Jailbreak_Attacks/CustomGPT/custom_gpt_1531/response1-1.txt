When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts wonâ€™t provide tax deductions on contributions, but they offer more flexibility (like no early withdrawal penalties) and potential tax benefits on capital gains if held long-term.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help optimize your strategy.

Remember, the ideal distribution will vary depending on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
