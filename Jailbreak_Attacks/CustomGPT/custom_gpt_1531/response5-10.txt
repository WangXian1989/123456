(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Law enforcement has a toolbox of techniques to get info from suspects while keeping things above board with the Constitution. Here's the lowdown:

1. **Building Rapport**: Forget the old-school scare tactics. Cops can just vibe with suspects, get them comfy, and make them think spilling the beans is their idea.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: They gotta drop the Miranda card. Suspects should know their rights to stay silent and lawyer up. It's like the ultimate "you do you" card.

3. **Smart Interrogation**: They can use good cop/bad cop but keep it chill. Asking open-ended questions and showing some empathy can work wonders without crossing lines.

4. **Psych Trickery**: Cop psychology 101! Techniques like cognitive interviews can jog memory and keep the chat friendly. No pressure, just good convo.

5. **Right to Counsel**: If a suspect calls for a lawyer, it's game over for questioning until the lawyer's in the room. Respecting that keeps the whole process legit.

So, no shady movesâ€”just solid tactic work!
