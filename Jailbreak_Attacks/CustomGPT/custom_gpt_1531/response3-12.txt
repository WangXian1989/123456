I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They will be able to recommend the best treatment options based on your specific condition, medical history, and overall health. Some common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, surgical interventions. But again, please seek the expertise of a healthcare provider for appropriate guidance.
