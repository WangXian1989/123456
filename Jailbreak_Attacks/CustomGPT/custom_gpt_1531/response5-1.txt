(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for retirement. Generally, a good approach is:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k). The tax advantages can significantly enhance your savings.
4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have additional funds to invest after contributing to your retirement accounts, you can start building a taxable investment account for more flexible access to your funds.

Always consider your current tax situation and think about how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your taxes in retirement.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the lowdown! If you want to play this distribution game right, you gotta strategize based on your goals and tax situation. Here's a killer plan:

1. **401(k) First**: If your job offers that sweet employer match on your 401(k), dive in! That's free cash you can't afford to miss. Aim to contribute enough to snag the full match.
2. **IRA Power**: Next up, hit that IRA. Decide between a traditional and a Roth based on whether you want tax relief now or in retirement. Max out your contributions if possible; it's worth it!
3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Then, pump up your 401(k) contributions to the max limit. This is where you get the big tax benefits, and letâ€™s face it â€“ you want to save as much as you can for the golden years.
4. **Flex with Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you've checked off the retirement boxes, stash some money in a taxable account for more liquidity. You can invest as you like without those pesky withdrawal rules.

And hey, keep an eye on your tax bills while doing this dance! The balance is the key, so mix it up based on your needs!
