When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prefer Roth accounts where possible, as they allow for tax-free withdrawals. For short-term savings, prioritize taxable accounts to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk. This might mean holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions, adjusting as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a certified financial planner.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while balancing liquidity needs and long-term growth, you can create a solid investment strategy. Always remember to assess your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.
