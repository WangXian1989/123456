Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA if you qualify, as it can provide tax benefits.

3. **Assess tax implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less immediate income (like stocks) to defer taxes, and direct higher-tax investments (like bonds) to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify investments**: Maintain a mix of asset types across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Adjust based on age and goals**: Young investors might lean more heavily on growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market changes. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
