Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. They allow for easier access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on tax implications for withdrawals. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to your specific needs, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
