The best approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get any match, then max out an IRA if you can. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your immediate tax burden.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be very beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be the better option. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, age, and retirement goals. Consider holding more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes could apply.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k), and finally, tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. This approach can help optimize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities.
