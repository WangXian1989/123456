Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can provide tax advantages and help diversify your retirement funds.

3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k):**
   - After the IRA, continue to max out your 401(k) contributions if you can. The higher contribution limits are beneficial for saving more for retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you have any funds left over, put them into a taxable investment account. This can be useful for short-term goals or more flexible access to your funds.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth. Taxable accounts might have capital gains implications but allow for more immediate access.

6. **Adjust for Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments among the accounts. Some investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while others may do well in taxable accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
