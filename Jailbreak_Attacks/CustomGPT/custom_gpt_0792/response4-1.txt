Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Then consider maximizing your contributions if you have the capacity.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) allow your investments to grow without being taxed until withdrawal, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are useful for investments that you might want to access before retirement. Consider capital gains taxes and dividends while investing in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you may want to adopt a more conservative investment strategy, shifting towards more stable investments.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
