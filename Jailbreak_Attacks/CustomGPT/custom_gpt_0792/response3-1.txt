Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-term needs:** If you need liquidity in the near term, prioritize taxable accounts.
   - **Retirement goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Don’t overlap investment strategies in multiple accounts.

### 5. **Contribute to Roth Accounts**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Monitor your investments and contributions, adjusting as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the employer match.
2. **IRA:** Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds, focusing on longer-term growth and income generation.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy varies by individual. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
