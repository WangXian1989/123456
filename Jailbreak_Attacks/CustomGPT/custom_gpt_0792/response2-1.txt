Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for money you might need in the short term. Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k). You might want to consider more aggressive investments if you have a longer time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains strategies.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a safe liquid account before heavily investing.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investment among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
