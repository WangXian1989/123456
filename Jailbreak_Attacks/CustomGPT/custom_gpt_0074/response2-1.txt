Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (essentially free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. These can be good for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund in a savings account or money market fund outside of these accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations yearly based on market conditions and life changes (new job, promotions, etc.).

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% of your total contributions.
- **Roth IRA:** 25% of your total contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% of your total contributions.

This strategy can be adjusted based on your specific situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor a plan to your unique circumstances.
