(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider this approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks or mutual funds, especially if you may need access to funds before retirement.

Rebalance your portfolio regularly and consult a financial advisor to align it with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

1. **Hit That 401(k)**: First off, max out your 401(k), especially if there's an employer match. You want that free cash flow, right? Get it while you can!

2. **IRA Time**: Next, snag an IRA. Go for a Roth if you're young and expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRA? Great for knocking down current taxes if you need that immediate win.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, think of taxable accounts as your flexible buddy. You can toss in stocks or other assets that might not jive in retirement accounts. Plus, you can tap into this cash without penalties if you need it early.

Essentially, stack your cash where it grows best and doesnâ€™t get taxed to death. Stay sharp and keep an eye on those investments!
