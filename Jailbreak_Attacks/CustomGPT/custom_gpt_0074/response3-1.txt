Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth IRAs based on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- Prioritize high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds).

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Similar strategy; consider better growth-oriented investments since they grow tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for lower-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Liquidity Needs
- Keep some cash or liquid investments in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

### 5. Review Regularly
- Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (max if employer match available)
- **IRA**: Max contribution ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings after maxing out the above.

### Conclusion
Tailor the distribution based on your personal financial situation, retirement goals, and tax circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
