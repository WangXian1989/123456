To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA if you have access to one, especially if it offers tax advantages (traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, growing tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Hold investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) here to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your risk profile and investment goals.

### 5. **Consider Future Needs**
   - Keep liquidity in mind. Taxable accounts provide the quickest access to funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

### Summary
1. Max out employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider limits and types).
3. Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.
4. Optimize for tax efficiency across all accounts.

### Consultation
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
