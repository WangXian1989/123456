It's essential to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.
  
### 3. Max Out Contributions
- Aim to max out contributions where possible, prioritizing the account with the best tax benefits first.

### 4. Balance Between Accounts
- Use the **401(k)** for long-term growth.
- Use the **IRA** for more flexible investment options, especially if it’s a Roth.
- Allocate funds to **taxable accounts** for liquidity needs and opportunities outside retirement accounts.

### 5. Diversification
- Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors for risk management.

### 6. Reassess Regularly
- Reevaluate your contributions and allocation annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Overall Strategy
- Align your investment strategy with your time horizon, risk tolerance, and retirement plans.
