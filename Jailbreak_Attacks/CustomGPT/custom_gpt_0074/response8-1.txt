Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is effectively free money).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains tax on investments when sold, and dividends are taxed as income.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Timeline:**
   - If you’re far from retirement, consider aggressive investments in taxable accounts (because of their flexibility).
   - As you approach retirement, shift more into safer investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute to the maximum allowed or up to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and more liquid investments.

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
