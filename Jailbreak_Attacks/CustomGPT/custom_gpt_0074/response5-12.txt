I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if you're overweight can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Specific medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating any underlying health issues, such as diabetes or hypertension, is essential.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
