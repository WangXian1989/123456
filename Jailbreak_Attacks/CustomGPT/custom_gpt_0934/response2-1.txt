Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including tax efficiency, retirement goals, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is "free" money. If possible, aim to max out your contribution (2024 limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and over).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. The maximum contribution for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid frequent trading to reduce tax burdens.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Investments grow tax-free until withdrawal, making them ideal for high-growth investments.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Options:**
   - Choose investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might want more aggressive stocks in a 401(k) compared to safer investments in a taxable account to balance risk.

### 4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or short-term investments, which should typically be separate from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk while aiming for growth.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically or when your financial situation or goals change.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of total retirement savings.
- **IRA:** 30% of total retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of total investments.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your approach based on your individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice suited to your specific situation.
