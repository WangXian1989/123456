Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The latter offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Often includes a variety of funds. Choose a mix of equity and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: This account allows for greater flexibility in fund choices. Consider diversifying using index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with lower tax implications, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains stocks.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies if necessary.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Rebalance your portfolio at least once a year to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### **Example Distribution Strategy:**
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary, up to the employer match limit.
- **IRA**: $6,000 annually (or $7,000 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any excess after your 401(k) and IRA contributions or use for short-term goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
