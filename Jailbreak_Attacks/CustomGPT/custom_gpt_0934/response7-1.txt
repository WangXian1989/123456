Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering several factors, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, contribute enough to take full advantage of tax benefits.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If eligible, max out your contributions here after your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement age or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can hold investments in a way that minimizes capital gains tax, such as placing low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient ETFs here.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-term goals:** Allocate more towards taxable accounts, as you may need access sooner.
- **Medium-term (5-10 years):** Balance between taxable and IRAs, depending on your tax situation.
- **Long-term retirement savings:** Max out the 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
