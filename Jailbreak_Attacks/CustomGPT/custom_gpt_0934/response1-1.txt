Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here first. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current tax situation.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) (up to the IRS limit), consider funding either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly attractive for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These can be used flexibly with no penalties for withdrawal, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, but consider different strategies for each:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial advisor.

This strategy helps you maximize growth while managing tax implications.
