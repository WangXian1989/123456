Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions to a 401(k) are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Capital gains taxes apply when selling investments for a profit, so consider your investment strategy carefully.

2. **Liquidity Needs:** 
   - Assess your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, whereas retirement accounts have restrictions and may incur penalties if withdrawn before retirement age.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** 
   - Your investment strategy may differ based on whether you are investing for short-term or long-term goals. Long-term investments can often be placed in retirement accounts to benefit from compounding, while short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits:** 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For example, the 401(k) limits are typically higher than those of IRAs, so maximizing contributions according to the limits is crucial for tax-deferred growth.

5. **Diversification:** 
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This includes diversifying investments within each account to optimize growth and manage risk effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the best approach will vary based on personal circumstances, so it’s essential to develop a plan that fits your unique needs and goals.
