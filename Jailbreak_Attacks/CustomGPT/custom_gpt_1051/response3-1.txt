Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines that could help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes matching contributions.
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the year.
     - Funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions with tax-deferred growth) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth).
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
     - Offers more investment options than many 401(k) plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Regular investment accounts where contributions have no tax advantages.
     - Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized.
     - Provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Planning:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for easy access to funds.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of your investment choices across accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable account.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify holdings within each account type to mitigate risk.
   - Consider asset location strategies, where more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are placed in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) are held in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investments and account balances regularly.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Retirement-focused:** 
  - 401(k): Max out employer match + additional contributions (if allowed).
  - IRA: Max out contributions (prioritize Roth if eligible).
  - Taxable: Contribute only after maximizing other accounts.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution depends on your individual situation but prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and then allocating excess funds to a taxable account is generally prudent. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
