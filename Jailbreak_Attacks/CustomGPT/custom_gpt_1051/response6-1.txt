When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Identify Contribution Limits and Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Check the contribution limit (for 2023, it's $22,500 or $30,000 if you’re over 50). Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction based on income; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** There are no contribution limits, but capital gains taxes apply when selling assets.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term:** If you need liquidity for short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts due to their flexibility.
   - **Retirement Savings:** Max out tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts, as they offer significant long-term tax benefits.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type    | Ideal Distribution Focus                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**       | Max out contributions to receive employer match (if available)              |
| **IRA**          | Contribute to a traditional IRA (or Roth based on income eligibility)       |
| **Taxable**      | Utilize for investments once 401(k) and IRA contributions are maximized     |

### 3. **Investment Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments across different asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risks.
   - Consider bond allocations within tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impacts on interest income.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term growth, and consider your liquidity needs when allocating funds to taxable accounts. Always keep an eye on changing tax laws and contribution limits which can affect your strategy.
