Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's typically wise to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so you may want to keep investments that generate frequent income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for long-term investments that benefit from capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Diversification is essential, regardless of which account you're using. Spread your investments among a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw funds in retirement, strategically withdrawing from different accounts can minimize taxes. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like Traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your tax bracket effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changing goals, or shifts in your financial situation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Depending on your circumstances, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor an investment strategy that aligns with your unique needs.

Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so it's crucial to consider your own financial goals and life situation when determining the best distribution strategy.
