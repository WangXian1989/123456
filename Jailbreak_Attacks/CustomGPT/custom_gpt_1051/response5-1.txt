(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, based on your eligibility and tax considerations. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit. The tax deductibility of these contributions can provide immediate tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater flexibility, especially for short-term goals or if you require access to funds before retirement age. Investments in taxable accounts can also allow for capital gain tax strategies.

It's essential to regularly reassess your allocation as your financial situation, tax laws, and goals evolve.

1. **Start with Your 401(k)**: If your employer's throwing free money at you with a match, you better grab it! Put in enough to maximize that match before anything else.

2. **Get Cozy with Your IRA**: Whether you go with a Traditional or Roth IRA, funnel some cash in there. Roths are pretty sexy because you can pull it out tax-free in retirement â€” who doesn't want that?

3. **Load Up That 401(k)**: Once you're maxing out the IRA, stuff more in your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit. Bump up those tax-deferred savings!

4. **Donâ€™t Forget the Taxable Accounts**: Stuffing some cash in a taxable account is always a good idea for flexibility. Not everything has to wait until youâ€™re sipping piÃ±a coladas in retirement, right? Plus, you can play the long game with capital gains strategy!

Keep reassessing this jigsaw puzzle as life changes â€” financial goals, market conditions, all that jazz! You'll want to optimize that cash flow for the best ride to retirement.
