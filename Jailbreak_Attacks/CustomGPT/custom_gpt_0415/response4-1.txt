Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits. For example, 401(k)s have higher limits than IRAs. Maximize contributions to employer-matched 401(k) if applicable.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends. This can be beneficial for short-term needs or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.
   - Consider your timeline; longer investment horizons can tolerate more risk, which might influence asset allocation.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Typically, it’s wise to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Conservative investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on performance, changing goals, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
