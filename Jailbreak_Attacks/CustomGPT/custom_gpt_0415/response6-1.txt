Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible, or qualified withdrawals may be tax-free.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have accessible funds in a taxable account for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Long-Term Growth**
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (such as stocks) to maximize tax benefits over time.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account for balanced risk.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-25% up to match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,500/year for under 50, $7,500 for 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds for flexibility and investments not suitable for retirement accounts.

### Review Regularly
- Assess your allocations annually and adjust based on performance and financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
