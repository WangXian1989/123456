To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if offered). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. If your income allows, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on capital gains. 
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-generating assets, as these will be taxed at ordinary income rates in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses saved in a separate account before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your age, risk tolerance, and market outlook. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, strategically allocating investments based on taxation, and maintaining an emergency fund, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth.
