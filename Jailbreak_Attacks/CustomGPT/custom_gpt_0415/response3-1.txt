Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these are taxed differently than ordinary income. This can be beneficial for your overall tax strategy.

3. **Balance Risk and Investment Goals**:
   - Consider the investment options available in each account. Your 401(k) may offer limited choices compared to a brokerage account. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your long-term goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically covering 3 to 6 months of expenses.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments in response to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your unique circumstances.
