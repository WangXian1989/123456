When determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a structured approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: If a Roth IRA is an option, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, depending on your income and tax filing status.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diverse mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. The tax treatment for each type of account can influence how much you allocate to different assets. For example:
   - Place high-growth, high-volatility assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets (which produce ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Time Horizon and Access**: If you anticipate needing access to some funds sooner (for emergencies, major purchases, etc.), keep a portion in taxable accounts. Long-term savings can be prioritized in retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Make it a habit to review your investments annually to ensure they still align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, speak with a financial professional who can provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Balancing between immediate access to funds and long-term growth is crucial.
