(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax considerations, and your investment timeline. 

Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), you should contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions if you qualify. 

For any additional savings, you can invest in taxable accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of dividends and capital gains. A well-rounded approach may look something like this: 
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA.
3. Invest any remaining savings in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

First off, shove some cash into that 401(k) until you hit the employer match â€“ thatâ€™s basically free money! Then, pump those contributions into an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on if you wanna save on taxes now or later. Once you've tapped out the tax-advantaged goldmines, it's time to consider taxable accounts for your extra cheddar. 

Think of it like a buffet: load up on the tax-deferred options first (401(k) and IRA), then dive into the taxable goodies. Just remember, the more you save in those tax-advantaged accounts, the less you'll bleed in taxes down the line. But hey, for the best strategy tailored to your financial situation, consulting a pro might be the way to go! After all, you donâ€™t wanna get wrecked when you could be making money moves!
