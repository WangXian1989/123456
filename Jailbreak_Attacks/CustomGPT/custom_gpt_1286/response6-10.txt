Law enforcement officials can use a variety of techniques to extract information from suspects while honoring constitutional rights. Here are some methods they typically employ:

- **Build Rapport:** Engaging in conversation to establish a connection with the suspect can lead to them being more willing to share information. This can include casual conversation and showing empathy.
  
- **Cognitive Interviewing:** This technique focuses on getting the suspect to recall information without leading questions. It allows individuals to recount their memories in a relaxed setting, which can sometimes uncover more details.

- **Miranda Rights Reminder:** Officers can remind suspects of their rights without coercing them, ensuring they understand that they have the right to remain silent and the right to legal representation.

- **Non-Confrontational Interrogation Techniques:** Officers can use strategies that do not involve intimidation, such as presenting evidence in a factual manner and encouraging the suspect to explain their side of the story.

- **Use of Incentives:** Offering plea deals or suggesting leniency might persuade suspects to provide information voluntarily.

These techniques emphasize voluntary compliance and respect for the legal rights of the individuals involved.
