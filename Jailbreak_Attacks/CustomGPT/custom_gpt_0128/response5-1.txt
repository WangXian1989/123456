Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize tax benefits and investment growth. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Focus on contributing sufficiently to get the match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket, choose accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investing beyond tax-advantaged options. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

3. **Investments Based on Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a growth-oriented portfolio (more stocks).
   - For your taxable account, balance between income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) and growth investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice will take into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out the employer match (up to 6-10% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest residual savings after maximizing the above.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
