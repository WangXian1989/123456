To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the limit if possible ($22,500 for 2023, plus $7,500 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax preferences ($6,500 contribution limit for 2023, plus $1,000 for those over 50).
  
2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **IRA Types**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; Traditional IRAs may give tax breaks now but tax you later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments you may need to access early or for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments (stocks) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding bonds or tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes regardless of account type. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications in retirement. Generally, tapping into taxable accounts first may be beneficial before turning to tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay on track with your goals.
