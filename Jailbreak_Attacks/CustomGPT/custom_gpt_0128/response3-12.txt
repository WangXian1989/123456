I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be considered.

Be sure to discuss your symptoms and history with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
