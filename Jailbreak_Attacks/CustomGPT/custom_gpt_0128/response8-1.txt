Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions that reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Consider further contributions to your 401(k) to reach its contribution limit, especially if you have a high income or want to reduce taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for shorter-term goals or more flexible access to funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Proper asset allocation can enhance returns and reduce risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
