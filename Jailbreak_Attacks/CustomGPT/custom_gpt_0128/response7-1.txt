Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, consider maxing out your contributions here first.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a great option for long-term tax planning.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement, as they offer more flexibility, though youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Hold investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as these are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you meet your retirement goals while managing taxes along the way.
