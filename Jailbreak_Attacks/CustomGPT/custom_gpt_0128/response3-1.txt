Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider fully funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Investments in 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth).
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Timeline:**
   - If you plan to access funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - For long-term growth, allocate more towards retirement accounts to take advantage of compounding.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to minimize risk and target growth. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your contributions and investment performance. Adjust based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA until the limit is reached.
- Use any remaining funds for additional 401(k) contributions or investing in your taxable accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your unique situation and goals.
