To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Prioritize funding a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments here since withdrawals are taxed at retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but also consider tax implications when withdrawing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds and other taxable investments here.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations to maintain your target asset mix, considering the changing tax implications and market conditions.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan which accounts to draw from in retirement to minimize tax burdens, often leading from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free (Roth).

This balanced approach maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liability over time.
