Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Max out any employer match to take advantage of free money.
   - Consider if you want to use a traditional or Roth 401(k) based on your tax situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax strategy.
   - Aim to max out IRAs if possible, as they provide tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Regularly rebalance to maintain desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Keep an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account before investing aggressively.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
