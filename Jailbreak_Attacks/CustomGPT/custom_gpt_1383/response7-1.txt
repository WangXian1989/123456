The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider making contributions to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRA) for your assets that may appreciate most in value over time. This can help you minimize taxes on your gains until retirement.

3. **Tax-Free Growth**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for after-tax growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. This could be beneficial for your longer-term growth strategy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts strategically for investments that generate income or short-term gains, as they could be taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains. 

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Distribute your investments considering your current and expected future tax brackets. Balancing between tax-deferred and taxable accounts can help create a more tax-efficient withdrawal strategy in retirement.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are sufficiently diversified to reduce risk while aligning with your investment timeline and risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
