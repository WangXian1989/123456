I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment can vary depending on the specific condition and its severity. Some common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or in severe cases, liver transplantation. Make sure to reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice!
