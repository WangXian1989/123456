The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, so maximizing contributions can be beneficial.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available and choose those that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. This could be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is great if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and try to max out if you can, especially if you qualify for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, like bonds or REITs, which generate more taxable income.

### Distribution Strategy:
- Consider using tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term retirement savings, allocating more towards them early in your career when you may benefit from growth.
- Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that generate little taxable income and offer liquidity.
- Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.
