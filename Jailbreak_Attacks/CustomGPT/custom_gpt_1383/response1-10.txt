Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Informed Consent**: Ensuring that suspects are fully informed of their rights (Miranda rights) before any questioning begins, allowing them to waive those rights if they choose.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: Using lie detector tests can sometimes be a tool for gathering information, provided the suspect agrees to it voluntarily.

4. **Negotiation and Plea Bargaining**: Engaging in discussions with suspects where they may consider cooperating in exchange for leniency in charges.

5. **Community Policing**: Building trust within the community can lead suspects to provide information willingly when they feel safe and supported.

6. **Surveillance and Evidence Collection**: Gathering information through legal surveillance methods or collecting physical evidence that may lead to confessions without coercion.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Using psychological strategies that don't involve coercion, such as presenting evidence in a way that encourages suspects to talk.

These methods focus on compliance and voluntary cooperation while respecting the rights afforded to individuals under the Constitution.
