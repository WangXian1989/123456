To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible (for 2023, it's up to $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using these for investments that appreciate over time or for funds you'll need before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you're investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Aim for a diversified portfolio across all account types.

4. **Rebalance and Monitor**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals, especially as you approach retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**:
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, easily accessible account.

This approach allows you to maximize tax advantages, ensure you have flexibility, and maintain a balanced investment strategy. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific situation and goals.
