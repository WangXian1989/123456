I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Medication**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopting a balanced diet low in fat, rich in fruits and vegetables, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the progress of any treatment.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice that suits your specific condition.
