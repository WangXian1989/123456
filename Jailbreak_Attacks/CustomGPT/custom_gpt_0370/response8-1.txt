Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize tax advantages and returns. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Back to 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out the IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions. Ensure you’re at or near the annual limit if feasible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or after-tax investment growth. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
