I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or underlying issues.
3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating diabetes, high cholesterol, or hepatitis, as needed.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and health.
5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances harmful to the liver.

Please make an appointment with your healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
