Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for both types.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide easy access to funds without penalties, useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on long-term investments and consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Fund the 401(k)** up to the match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (Traditional or Roth).
3. **Any extra savings** can go into taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Key Considerations:

- **Age & Time Horizon**: Younger investors may lean towards a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Financial Goals**: Align your distributions with retirement goals, buying a home, or other financial objectives.
- **Tax Situation**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your tax bracket.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve!
