To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA next. This allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the Roth, boost your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit, especially if your income might lead to tax implications.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains. Consider tax-efficient funds and individual stocks held long-term.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes when withdrawing from these accounts. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as income, whereas Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth potential while managing tax implications. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
