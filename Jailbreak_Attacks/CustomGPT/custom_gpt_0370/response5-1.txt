Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or investments that may generate taxable income, like dividends or interest.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher growth investments belong in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
