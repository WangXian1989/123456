I'm not a healthcare professional, but it's important to consult with a doctor for accurate medical advice tailored to your condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver issue. In some cases, procedures or surgery might be necessary. Again, please seek professional medical guidance for your situation.
