The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider investing in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxes**: Taxable accounts should hold investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread out your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk and increase potential returns.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Reevaluate your asset allocation and contributions periodically based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to help tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs.

Keep in mind that each individual's situation is unique, and these are general guidelines that may need adjustment based on personal circumstances.
