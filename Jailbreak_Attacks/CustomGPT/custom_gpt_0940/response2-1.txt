Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may come with employer matches. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least get the full employer match. This is effectively "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Pre-tax vs. After-tax**: Max out tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) before putting money into taxable accounts, as they offer tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, strategically withdraw from each account to manage your tax bracket effectively.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering that your tax-advantaged accounts might focus more on long-term growth, while taxable accounts might lean towards more liquid investments.

### 5. **Account Contributions Based on Age**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Consider maximizing contributions to Roth accounts (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
   - **Near Retirement**: Focus on Traditional accounts to reduce taxable income and have a solid withdrawal strategy in place.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually and adjust contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
2. Contribute to IRAs (Roth or Traditional depending on your tax situation).
3. Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatments (e.g., index funds).

### Final Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
- Stay informed about contribution limits and rule changes in retirement accounts to optimize your strategy over time.

This balanced approach helps in leveraging the strengths of each account type while managing risks and taxes effectively.
