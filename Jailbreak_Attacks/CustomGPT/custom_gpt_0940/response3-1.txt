Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax liabilities. Here's a strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Understand the Purpose of Each Account:**
   - **401(k):** This employer-sponsored plan often comes with tax benefits, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. It allows pre-tax or post-tax contributions, depending on whether it's traditional or Roth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar to the 401(k), IRAs can provide tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t have the same tax benefits but offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. The annual contribution limits (for 2024, these are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50) make this crucial for maximizing growth.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prefer Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) since you pay taxes on contributions now, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences. Place less volatile investments (like bonds or dividend-generating stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts effectively.

### 6. **Ongoing Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations, account balances, and goals. Adjust as necessary, especially as tax laws or your financial situation changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match.
2. Contribute to your IRA up to the maximum limit.
3. Return to your 401(k) and ensure you’re contributing as much as possible within the annual limit.
4. After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional savings for your taxable accounts based on your investment strategy.

### Conclusion:
This strategy balances long-term growth and tax implications across your accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
