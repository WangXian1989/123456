To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. If your plan allows, consider maximizing your contributions if you're under 50, or the catch-up limits if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide current tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Place assets with potential for high growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Assets:** Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, where you may prefer to manage the tax implications more actively.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Depending on your financial goals and age, consider how withdrawals will be taxed. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio annually to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance, making sure your allocations in each account remain balanced.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have adequate savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies—this keeps your investments intact for growth.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Summary:
Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, allocate investments strategically for growth, and keep an emergency fund separate. Rebalance your portfolios annually to stay aligned with your goals.
