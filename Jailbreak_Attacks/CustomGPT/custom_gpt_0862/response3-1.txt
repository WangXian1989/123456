To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Your Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This includes retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically allows for higher contribution limits and may include employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (taxed now, tax-free withdrawals). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility and liquidity, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they are realized.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current tax bracket and how withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) will affect your tax situation in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments across all accounts to maximize tax efficiency. For instance, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

5. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Max out contributions to your employer's 401(k) to take advantage of any match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.

6. **Create a Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider drawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance, market changes, and life events.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If needed, work with a financial professional to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.

In summary, a balanced approach that considers your financial goals, the tax implications of each account type, and your investment strategy will help you distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
