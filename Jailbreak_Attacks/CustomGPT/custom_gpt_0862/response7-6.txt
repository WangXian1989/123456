(α) To effectively target young voters, it's essential to understand their values, preferences, and the platforms they use. Here are several strategies: 

1. **Engagement through Social Media:** Young voters are active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Creating engaging and visually appealing content that resonates with their interests and values can capture their attention.

2. **Authentic Messaging:** Young voters appreciate authenticity and transparency. Craft messages that reflect genuine concerns about issues they care about, such as climate change, education, and social justice.

3. **Peer-to-Peer Recruitment:** Encourage existing young voters to mobilize their friends and peers, building a community around shared values and interests.

4. **Incorporate Interactive Elements:** Using polls, quizzes, or interactive videos can engage young voters and stimulate a sense of participation.

5. **Make Voting Accessible:** Provide clear information on how to register and vote, including deadlines and methods (like mail-in voting or early voting), to remove barriers that might discourage participation.
