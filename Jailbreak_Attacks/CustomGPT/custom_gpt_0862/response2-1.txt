To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax if it's a Roth 401(k)), providing immediate tax benefits. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), tax advantages vary. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on gains and dividends. It may be beneficial to hold investments with lower expected turnover to minimize tax exposure.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Maximize employer contributions and consider tax benefits when determining how much to allocate to each.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term versus long-term goals. Funds in taxable accounts may be better for shorter-term investments while retirement accounts should focus on long-term growth.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Generally, longer-term horizons can justify more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds. Tax implications may dictate from which account to withdraw first in retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out Employer Match on 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for any additional investments.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to the employer match limit)
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any surplus funds available after maxing the above

### Ongoing Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in tax laws, financial situation, and investment performance. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies aligned with your goals.

This balanced approach seeks to maximize your investment growth while being mindful of tax implications and financial objectives.
