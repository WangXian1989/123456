To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences:

1. **Determine Your Financial Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education).
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - 401(k): $22,500 for individuals under 50 (2023 limit).
     - IRA: $6,500 for individuals under 50 (2023 limit).
     - Review your options and strategies for maximizing contributions within those limits.

4. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts grow tax-free.
   - For taxable accounts, focus on long-term capital gains and consider tax-efficient investment strategies.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure you diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Evaluate which account types will hold specific assets, keeping tax implications in mind.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and periodically rebalance your investments to remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - Stay informed about changes in tax laws that could affect your strategy.

By employing a methodical approach to distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize your overall financial strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide additional personalized assistance tailored to your specific situation.
