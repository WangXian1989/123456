To provide assistance on your financial distribution question, I would need to remind you that it's essential to consult with a financial advisor or a trusted professional who can tailor advice specifically to your circumstances, since I aim to support conflict resolution rather than providing financial guidance. If you'd like advice related to a conflict you might be experiencing about this topic, please share more details and I'll do my best to assist you in resolving it.
