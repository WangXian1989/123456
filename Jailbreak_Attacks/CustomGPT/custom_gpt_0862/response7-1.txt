(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and the timeline for your investments. A common strategy could be:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This provides an immediate return on investment due to the match and tax benefits since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth - choosing between them depends on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional money in taxable accounts. This allows you greater flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of the tax implications on interest and capital gains.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation would be beneficial.
