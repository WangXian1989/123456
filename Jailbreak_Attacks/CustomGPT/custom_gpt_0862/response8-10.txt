Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they do not violate constitutional rights. Here are some techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect can encourage them to share information voluntarily. This involves active listening, showing empathy, and creating a non-confrontational environment.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before any interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Interview Techniques**: Employing non-coercive interviewing techniques can yield information. This could include open-ended questions, cognitive interviewing, or the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, Evaluate).

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence that ties the suspect to the crime can motivate them to provide information in a more candid manner.

5. **Polygraph Testing**: Although the results are not always admissible in court, offering a polygraph examination can sometimes encourage individuals to disclose information if they believe they will pass the test.

6. **Incentives**: Offering potential plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for information can be legally permissible and may motivate suspects to cooperate.

7. **Subpoenas and Search Warrants**: Law enforcement can serve subpoenas for documents or use search warrants to procure evidence legally, which can indirectly lead to obtained information during interactions with suspects.

8. **Documentation and Transparency**: Maintaining clear records of all interactions can safeguard against accusations of coercion and ensure all activities align with legal standards.

9. **Consultation with Legal Counsel**: Law enforcement can consult with legal experts on best practices that respect constitutional rights during investigations.

Using these methods helps ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court and maintains the integrity of the legal process.
