Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA:** Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** You pay capital gains tax on any profits made upon selling investments, but you have flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Consider Contribution Limits
- Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like your 401(k) to benefit from any matching contributions. For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
- For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). 

### 3. Prioritize Based on Goals
- **Short-term goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need in the near future.
- **Long-term goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings, ensuring tax efficiency.

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy
- Diversify your investments within each account type and adjust based on risk tolerance. Utilize tax-efficient investment strategies by placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
By analyzing your financial situation and goals, you can create a strategy that optimally distributes your investments across these accounts. For personalized advice, consulting a financial advisor would be a prudent decision.
