It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money across different investment accounts! Here are some general guidelines on how to approach this:

1. **Understand Your Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will help you decide how much to allocate to different accounts.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on your risk tolerance and asset allocation strategy. Generally, younger investors might opt for a more aggressive allocation (more stocks), while those closer to retirement may shift to more conservative investments (bonds).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify within each account type to mitigate risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Each account type has different tax implications. For instance, it's generally better to hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's essential to tailor your strategy based on your individual needs and goals.
