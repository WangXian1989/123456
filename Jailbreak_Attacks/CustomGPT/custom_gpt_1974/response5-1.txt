Determining the best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (for Roth 401(k)), which helps reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Traditional vs. Roth**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA could be advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if your financial situation allows it. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax, and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA. Next, consider any additional contributions to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your goals.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Financial Goals**: Align your strategy with short-term (like a house purchase) and long-term goals (like retirement).
- **Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize your contributions.
