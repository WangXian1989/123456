To allocate your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Roth vs. Traditional**: If your employer offers both, choose based on your current tax situation and expected future income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth or Traditional IRA**: Decide between them based on your anticipated tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Retirement Accounts**: Consider contributing to taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on holding investments that generate qualified dividends, long-term capital gains, or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Rebalance periodically to ensure alignment with your investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdrawal from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Summary Approach:
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.**
2. **Maximize either Roth or Traditional IRA contributions.**
3. **Fund taxable accounts based on leftover savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.**
