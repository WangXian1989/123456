Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If your goals are short-term (e.g., buying a house), lean more towards taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place *high-growth investments* (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for *bonds or conservative investments* since they generate interest that is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 4. **Diversified Investments**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced, regardless of account type. Allocate across asset classes to manage risk.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary until you hit the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings. A common strategy is to maintain a stock-bond ratio that aligns with your risk tolerance.
