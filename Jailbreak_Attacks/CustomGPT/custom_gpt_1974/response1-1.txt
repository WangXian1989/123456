Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is consistent across all accounts, considering the tax implications of each type of investment.

5. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how and when you will access these funds. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts are best to keep growing until retirement, while taxable accounts may provide more liquidity.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and personal finances, consulting with an advisor can provide tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
