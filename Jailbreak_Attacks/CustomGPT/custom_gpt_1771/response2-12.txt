   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications like antivirals or corticosteroids may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Completely avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Controlling diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure can be crucial.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.
