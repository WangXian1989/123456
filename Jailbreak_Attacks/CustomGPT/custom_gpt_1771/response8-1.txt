When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing employer contributions, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. This can reduce your taxable income in the present if it's pre-tax.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These are flexible and can provide liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments longer to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance assets among accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and minimize risk.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Plan your investments considering the tax implications of each account type. Generally, place higher-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, tailor your approach based on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
