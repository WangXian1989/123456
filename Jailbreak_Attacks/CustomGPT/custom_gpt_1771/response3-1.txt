The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out employer matching, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If you're able, aim to max out your 401(k) (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Bracket Consideration**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial since contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed then.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, keep more aggressive investments such as stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax deferral. Place more stable investments, such as bonds, in taxable accounts to efficiently manage taxes on interest income.

5. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses, in a liquid and easily accessible account.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**:
   - Review the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k). Sometimes, IRAs offer better investment choices and lower fees, allowing greater flexibility.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

By taking these steps, you can effectively manage your retirement savings and optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
