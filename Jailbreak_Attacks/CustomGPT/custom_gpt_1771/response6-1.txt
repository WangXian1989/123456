To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Maximize your contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** Contribute up to $6,500 annually ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Good for tax deferral; consider employer match as free money.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax-deductible contributions depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, ideal for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Choices**
   - **401(k):** Often limited to predefined investment options; select funds with low fees and strong performance.
   - **IRA:** More flexibility to choose investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs); consider diversifying across sectors and asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that minimize tax liability (e.g., index funds); be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Balance Your Portfolio**
   - Maintain a diversified mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk. Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations and performance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market opportunities.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize your retirement savings for both short-term growth and long-term security.
