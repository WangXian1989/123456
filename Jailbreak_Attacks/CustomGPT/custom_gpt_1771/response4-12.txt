I'm not a doctor, but I recommend seeing a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options depend on the specific condition. Generally, lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and, in some cases, procedures or surgeries may be necessary. Conditions like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis each have different approaches. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan from a medical expert.
