When planning to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50). The immediate tax deduction is beneficial, and funds grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions; a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher taxable income (like bonds) or for money that you may need in the short term. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Assess your current and expected future tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider more contributions to a Roth IRA.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account type to manage risk and opportunities across different asset classes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, have a withdrawal plan that minimizes taxes by strategically withdrawing from each account type based on your tax bracket and income needs.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your goals and circumstances.
