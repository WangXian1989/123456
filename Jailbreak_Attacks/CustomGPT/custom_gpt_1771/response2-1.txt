Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be optimized based on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contributions to a taxable account can provide flexibility. Consider using these for:
   - Short-term needs (less than five years).
   - Investments that generate long-term capital gains to minimize tax burden.
  
4. **Invest According to Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiency.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically based on the tax implications and your retirement needs. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review Annually**: Reassess your strategy annually or with any major life changes, like a raise or change in expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
