Distributing your money across different types of investment accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out your employer match first, if available; this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum limit if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it provides immediate tax benefits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you want a tax deduction now, go for a Traditional IRA. Max out contributions based on your situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that might be needed before retirement age or for goals in the near term (like buying a house).
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
- Review your allocations regularly based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

It's a smart idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized, professional advice tailored to your circumstances.
