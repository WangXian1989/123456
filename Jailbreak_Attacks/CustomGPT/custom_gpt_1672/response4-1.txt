It's generally advisable to consult a financial advisor or conduct thorough research tailored to your specific financial situation for the best strategies in distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, a common approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then funding an IRA, and finally allocating funds to taxable accounts. Each account type has unique tax implications and benefits, so considering your current tax bracket, financial goals, and investment timeline is essential. Always ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and are diversified to minimize risk.
