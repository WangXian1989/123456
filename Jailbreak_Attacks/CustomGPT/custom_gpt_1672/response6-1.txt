Distributing your money among different account types such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Investments Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this account for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. 
   - **Bond Investments**: If you hold bonds or other interest-generating assets, consider keeping them in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to avoid immediate taxation.

3. **Consider Your Future Tax Situation**:
   - Evaluate your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA could be beneficial to avoid paying taxes on withdrawals later.

4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term expenses, as withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties and tax implications if you're under age 59Â½.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create an optimal strategy for distributing your money across these accounts, ultimately enhancing your financial growth and retirement readiness. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
