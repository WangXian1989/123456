To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Focus on employer-sponsored funds with low fees and a diverse mix of assets (stocks, bonds).
   - **IRA:** Choose a mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully to minimize taxes in retirement. Use taxable accounts first for expenses, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reevaluate your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
