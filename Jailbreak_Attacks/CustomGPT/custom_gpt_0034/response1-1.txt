Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50+), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This could include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term capital gains. Consider keeping more short-term or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds during retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free (like Roth IRAs).

### 6. **Regular Reviews**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your unique situation, so consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
