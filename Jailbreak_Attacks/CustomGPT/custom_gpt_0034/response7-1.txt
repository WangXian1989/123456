Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here are key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Choose investments wisely to minimize taxes, such as:
   - Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth.
   - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher tax rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation based on market changes and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach based on personal circumstances.

This balanced approach helps in maximizing returns while managing tax implications effectively.
