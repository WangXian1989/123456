To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to take advantage of any matching funds.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax advantages, especially if it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Evaluate which type suits your tax situation better.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but are subject to capital gains tax. Suitable for short-term needs.

### 2. **Establish Your Goals:**
   - Determine your investment horizon (short-term vs. long-term).
   - Identify specific financial goals, such as retirement, purchasing a home, or education expenses.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Prioritize investments that generate high taxable distributions (like bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency; they typically yield lower capital gains and distribute less income.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider a mix of domestic and international investments.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and achieve growth.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Expenses:**
   - Choose investment options with lower fees, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By carefully considering the strengths of each account type and your individual goals, you can create an effective distribution strategy.
