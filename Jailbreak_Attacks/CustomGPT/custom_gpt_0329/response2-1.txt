Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals and situation. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your contributions if you can; 401(k)s have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Consider putting money into a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need prior to retirement or for goals like buying a home or funding education.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.**
2. **Max out IRA contributions.**
3. **Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility.**

### **Projected Growth and Risk:**
- Diversify investments within each account (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
- Reassess your allocations periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

Happy investing!
