To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high employer matching, invest here next. It allows for pre-tax contributions and may have a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for:
   - Investments that generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
   - Flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Keep your investments diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Beware of high fees that can eat into your returns, especially in your 401(k).

Consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies specific to your situation and goals.
