I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Focus on a balanced, low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Alcohol: Limit or eliminate alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Follow-up appointments for blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures like liver biopsies, or in severe cases, liver transplants may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements or acupuncture, but consult your doctor before trying these.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to tailor treatment to your specific situation.
