Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions.
   - For traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, contributions reduce your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if youâ€™re currently in a high tax bracket.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
     - Stocks for growth (more suitable for long-term).
     - Bonds for stability (for conservative or near-term needs).

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20% of total savings (max to match)
- **IRA**: 30% of total savings
- **Taxable Account**: 50% of total savings (for flexibility and liquidity)

Adjust these proportions based on your financial goals and life stage.
