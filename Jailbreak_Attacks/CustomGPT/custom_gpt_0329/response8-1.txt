Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Growth and Withdrawals**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs and taxable accounts are subject to different tax treatments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across these accounts to balance risk and growth potential. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon for each account differently.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review and adjust your allocations yearly to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**
   - Strategize how and when to withdraw funds from different accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize your income.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income until you reach the maximum contribution.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable each year.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances. Happy investing!
