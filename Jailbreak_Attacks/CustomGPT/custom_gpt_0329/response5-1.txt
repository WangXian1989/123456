Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be better.

### 3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if it offers a good range of investment options.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or after-tax investments. They can offer flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. 
- **Investment Strategy:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a wise option to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
