Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - *401(k):* Contribute up to the employer match if available. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - *IRA:* Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Aim for the maximum contribution limit.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - *Taxable Accounts:* Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed more favorably compared to ordinary income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Ideally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often works best, focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged growth while managing tax liabilities effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
