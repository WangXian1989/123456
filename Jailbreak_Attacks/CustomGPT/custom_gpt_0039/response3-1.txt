To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (annual limit is $22,500 for 2024).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to max this out as well (annual limit is $6,500 for 2024).

2. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable investments or income-generating assets (like bonds) in your 401(k) and Traditional IRA to benefit from tax deferral.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts for optimal tax efficiency.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities over time.
