Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially to a Roth IRA if you qualify, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate higher taxes, like bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
   - Keep investments with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts where capital gains can be taxed more favorably.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before maximizing long-term retirement accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
