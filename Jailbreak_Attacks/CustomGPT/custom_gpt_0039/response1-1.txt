Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax benefits now.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. Consider a Roth 401(k) if your employer offers it.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. This is also useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance as needed, considering market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the benefits of tax-loss harvesting.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach should help optimize your investment and tax strategy.
