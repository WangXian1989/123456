Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep cash reserves for emergencies in taxable accounts where you have easy access.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary based on changing goals or market conditions.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, potentially taking from taxable accounts first and tax-advantaged accounts later.
