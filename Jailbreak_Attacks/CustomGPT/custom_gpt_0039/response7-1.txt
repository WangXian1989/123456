Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **401(k)**: If you're not maxing it out yet, aim to increase contributions up to the limit.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Last**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use these accounts for investments that may have high turnover or lower potential for growth.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Invest aggressively in your retirement accounts if you have a long time until retirement. For shorter-term goals, consider safer investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of where you invest, ensure your portfolio is diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market changes, and your evolving financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored insights based on your specific situation.
