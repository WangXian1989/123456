   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - If alcohol contributes to the problem, abstaining is crucial.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
