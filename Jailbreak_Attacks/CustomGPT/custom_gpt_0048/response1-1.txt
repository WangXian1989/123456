Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Sponsored Plans**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for investments you may need to access before retirement age without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

**Strategy Based on Age and Goals**:
- **Younger Investors**: Focus on growth (more in equities).
- **Near Retirement**: Shift towards preservation (more in bonds, less volatility).

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
