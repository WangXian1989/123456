To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Evaluate Taxation of Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid high-turnover investments to reduce taxable events.
   - **Bonds**: If you plan to invest in bonds, consider placing them in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Equities may be more suitable for long-term accounts, while fixed-income investments can stabilize short-term portfolios.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Retirement**: Plan when to withdraw from each account. Generally, it's better to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to minimize taxes in retirement.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and carefully managing your investments based on their tax implications, you can optimize your financial growth and minimize taxes.
