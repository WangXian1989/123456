Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you prefer tax deduction now, prioritize a traditional IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should hold investments with lower expected returns and higher turnover, like bonds or actively managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes. Stocks that you plan to hold long-term can be beneficial here for lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals. This can be more difficult with multiple accounts, so keep an eye on overall portfolio balance.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs. In tax-advantaged accounts, you can hold higher-cost investments since they benefit from tax deferral.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically, considering your tax situation and the timing of withdrawals from each account.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
