The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k))
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may reduce taxable income now, taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals. Gain is taxed at capital gains rates; consider this if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Across all accounts, ensure diversification to manage risk. Include stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match (~6-10% of income).
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Contribute the maximum allowed (e.g., $6,500 in 2023).
- **Taxable account**: Invest remaining savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider individual circumstances by seeking professional advice, especially for tax implications.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and personal goals.
