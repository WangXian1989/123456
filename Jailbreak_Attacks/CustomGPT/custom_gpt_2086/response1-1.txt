The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are suitable for short-term goals or as a source of income in retirement, though youâ€™ll pay taxes on gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: In each account, focus on a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

This strategy provides a balanced approach to optimizing your retirement savings while managing tax implications.
