I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options typically recommended for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes dietary modifications, regular exercise, and weight management to reduce the burden on the liver.

2. **Medications**: Certain liver conditions may require medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to lower cholesterol and manage fatty liver disease.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: It's crucial to limit or eliminate alcohol intake if you have liver problems, as it can worsen liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up visits with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and determine if additional interventions are necessary.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, like liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
