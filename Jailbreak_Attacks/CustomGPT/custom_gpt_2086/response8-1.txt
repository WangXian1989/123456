To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money. Fund this account up to the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**:
   - If youâ€™re currently in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA could be advantageous as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - For higher earners, a Traditional IRA might provide immediate tax benefits, but be mindful of income limits for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility, since you can withdraw contributions without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts where your investments can compound tax-deferred.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, and consider how tax implications might impact your allocation choices.
   - Generally, keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your contributions and investment performance. Adjust your distributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

By focusing on these areas, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money across these accounts.
