Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The annual contribution limits are lower than those for 401(k)s, but IRAs can offer more investment options.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Consider the tax implications of pre-tax vs. Roth contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you can still save after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting money into a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax benefits and implications of each account type. For instance, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for funds you won’t need for a while, and use taxable accounts for investments you'll access sooner.

6. **Diversification of Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment choices are well diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
