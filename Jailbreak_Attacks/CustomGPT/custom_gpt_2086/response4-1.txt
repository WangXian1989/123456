When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize this account for higher contributions due to potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term growth strategies may be more suited to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more liquid, shorter-term goals could warrant investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Be mindful of how and when you plan to withdraw from these accounts. For instance, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if rules are followed.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first before adding funds to taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across different account types and asset classes to manage risk and ensure that your portfolio aligns with your overall financial strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy that meets your unique financial situation and long-term goals.

Balancing your contributions effectively can help maximize your retirement savings and minimize taxes over time.
