Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA after the 401(k). These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age (e.g., for a home purchase or educational expenses). These are also good for short-term goals since they can provide liquidity without penalty.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may be taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider having more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your current financial situation and retirement goals.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
