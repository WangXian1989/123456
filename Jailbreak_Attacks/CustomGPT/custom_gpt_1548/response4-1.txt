To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Diversify Investment Choices**: Ensure each account has a diversified portfolio. This may include stocks, bonds, and other assets, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Use your taxable accounts for flexibility in accessing funds and for short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute to different accounts, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: In retirement, the order of withdrawals can also matter. Generally, tap taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional 401(k)), and then tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your overall financial picture and goals.

By considering the above strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to managing your investments.
