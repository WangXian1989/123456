To effectively distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; then max out your IRA contributions. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth.
   - **Utilize Roth Options**: If available, consider a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - **Put Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Since bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, place bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Hold Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: Stocks can be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts due to capital gains treatment.

3. **Account Liquidity and Retirement Timeline**:
   - **Consider Accessibility**: If you need to withdraw funds before retirement, focus on taxable accounts for less penalty and quicker access.
   - **Long-Term Growth Focus**: For accounts intended for long-term growth, prioritize equities, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**: Across all accounts, ensure diversification to manage risk effectively. Adjust based on individual accountsâ€™ performance and your financial goals.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your intended asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
