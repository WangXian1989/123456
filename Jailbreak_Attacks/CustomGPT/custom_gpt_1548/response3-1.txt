Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)). If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) can lower your taxable income. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Check your eligibility for tax-deductible contributions. If you qualify, prioritize contributing to a traditional IRA. Otherwise, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield short-term gains or require liquidity. Theyâ€™re also useful for any funds needed before retirement age.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts might be accessed first for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts should be tapped later to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

5. **Annual Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize these contributions when possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy, so seeking personalized advice is often beneficial.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your needs.
