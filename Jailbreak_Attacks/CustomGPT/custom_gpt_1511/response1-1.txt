Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes on profits. These accounts offer flexibility, as you can withdraw anytime.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Goals**:
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), prioritize money in taxable accounts. For retirement, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to seek professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

By strategically using each account’s benefits, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency over time.
