To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. Aim for the annual contribution limit.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Choose a Roth vs. Traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth might be better.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth, focusing on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - Place more aggressive investments in Roth IRA due to its tax-free nature, optimizing long-term gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds needed in the short- to medium-term. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, strategize withdrawals based on tax implications. For example, consider tapping taxable accounts before tax-advantaged accounts to allow those to continue growing.
