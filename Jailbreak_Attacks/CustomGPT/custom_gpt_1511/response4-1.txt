Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deductible contributions, but subject to similar taxation upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement; consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account (401(k) and IRA limits vary annually).

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investments with your retirement age and risk tolerance. Longer time horizons can usually take on more risk (stocks), while shorter terms may favor more stability (bonds).

### 4. **Withdrawal Needs:**
   - If you plan to retire early, consider having funds in taxable or Roth accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties on retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to reduce risk.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions** if possible, to take full advantage of tax-advantaged growth.
2. **Consider the Roth option** if you expect higher future income.
3. **Use taxable accounts for investments** that might generate capital gains (e.g., stocks) since long-term capital gains are often taxed at lower rates.

### Review Regularly:
- Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
