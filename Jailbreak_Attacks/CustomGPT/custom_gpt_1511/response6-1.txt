To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investments**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates (like stocks) and for those you may need to access without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Use your 401(k) and IRAs primarily for long-term retirement investments, ideally with a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid, stable investments in taxable accounts if you plan to access funds in the short term.

3. **Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matches and higher contribution limits. Choose low-fee index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investing in tax-efficient funds and strategies, such as ETFs or funds with low turnover to minimize tax implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring that you spread your investments to manage risk effectively.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
- **Invest for the long-term** in retirement accounts and keep taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Diversify** across all your accounts for overall portfolio stability. 

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.
