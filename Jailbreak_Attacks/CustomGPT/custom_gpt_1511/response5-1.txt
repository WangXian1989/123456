Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a guideline to help you optimize your allocations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get full employer matching contributions first.
   - Consider tax implications: Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth options might be better for tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Determine which type suits you: A Traditional IRA can provide tax deduction benefits now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals, making it advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Aim for full contribution limits: Contribute the maximum allowable each year if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for shorter-term goals: Consider this for investments with a timeline of less than five years.
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments: Look for ETFs or index funds that generate less taxable income.

### Allocation Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavy investing.
- **Overall Strategy**: Consider your timeline, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. A generally balanced approach could be:
  - 15-20% in 401(k)
  - 10-15% in IRA
  - 5-10% in taxable accounts
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
