To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing significantly, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and are managing any high-interest debt.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Allocate funds based on growth potential, risk, and time horizon. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where tax impacts are deferred.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investment choices within each account to spread risk and improve potential returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
