(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out employer matching first, as it's essentially free money. Consider putting enough to reach that match before contributing further.

2. **IRA**: Whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, try to contribute the maximum allowed each year. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate lower tax rates or for short-term goals. Consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs that are tax-efficient.

Balancing these accounts effectively can lead to tax efficiency and growth potential.

1. **401(k)**: First off, hit that employer match like it’s a slam dunk! Free money? Yes, please! After that, keep maxing it out. You want to capitalize on tax-deferred growth, so pile that cash in.

2. **IRA**: Don’t sleep on your IRA, either. Whether you go with Traditional or Roth, max that baby out! If you think taxes will be a bummer in the future, Roth is your bestie. Otherwise, Traditional can save you some dough now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your wild card. Perfect for playing it smart with lower-taxed investments. Think index funds and ETFs that won’t get you slapped with capital gains every time you blink. Plus, this account is flexible for those “I need a vacation” funds.

Keep the balance tailored to your risk appetite and goals, and you’ll be golden!
