Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a detailed approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Personal retirement account with tax advantages; traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax benefits but provide flexibility for withdrawals; subject to capital gains taxes on gains realized.

### 2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Annual contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2023).
   - **IRA:** Annual contribution limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50).
   - Maximize contributions to accounts with employer matching first.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for assets expected to appreciate significantly.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts for potentially higher growth.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on your age and retirement timeline.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk, adjusting holdings based on account type and tax implications.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions.

### 7. **Entity-Specific Considerations:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to maximize this benefit.
   - Utilize IRAs for additional retirement savings beyond the 401(k).
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k):** Max out any employer match, then contribute up to the limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the max allowed ($6,500) if possible.
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments for more favorable tax treatment.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution depends on your financial situation, but starting with employer-sponsored contributions, then maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, and finally, strategically using taxable accounts is a robust approach. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
