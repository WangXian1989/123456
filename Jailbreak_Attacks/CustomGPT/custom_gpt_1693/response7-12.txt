I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. The best approach often depends on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis or medications to control cholesterol levels.

3. **Supplements**: Some people consider supplements, such as milk thistle; however, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess any progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant might be required.

Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
