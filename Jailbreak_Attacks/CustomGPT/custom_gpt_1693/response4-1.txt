Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a detailed strategy to optimize your distribution:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often includes employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Contribution limits apply.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Good for short-term goals and liquidity.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **Fund IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to increase.
- **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After fulfilling your IRA contributions, continue to increase your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. Evaluate Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Assess investment options available in your plan, focusing on low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.
- **IRA**: If you utilize a self-directed IRA, you may have broader investment choices. Consider a diversified portfolio across stocks, bonds, and REITs.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Choose investments that minimize taxable income (e.g., tax-efficient ETFs), and be mindful of capital gains distributions.

### 4. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket**: Stay aware of your current and projected tax brackets. Traditional accounts provide short-term tax benefits, while Roth accounts can be advantageous for long-term growth without taxes.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for strategic withdrawals in retirement from accounts with varied tax implications to minimize overall tax liability. 

### 5. Adjust for Risk and Time Horizon
- **Younger Investors**: Favor higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (which can compound over time).
- **Nearer Retirement**: Shift to more conservative investments, focusing on preservation of capital.

### 6. Regularly Rebalance
- **Portfolio Review**: Annually assess your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and allocation strategy.

### 7. Keep Emergency Fund Separate
- **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside these investment accounts to avoid premature withdrawals.

### Summary
Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, maximize IRA contributions next, and then funnel any additional saving into your 401(k) or taxable accounts as necessary. Always align your investment strategy with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly consult with a financial advisor to refine your approach based on life changes or financial developments.
