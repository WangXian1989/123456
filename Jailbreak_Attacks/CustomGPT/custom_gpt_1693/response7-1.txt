Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's how you might approach it:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes on profits. Consider holding assets longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailoring your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically re-evaluate your asset allocation and tax strategy, especially as your income and financial situation change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a robust investment strategy that supports your long-term financial goals.
