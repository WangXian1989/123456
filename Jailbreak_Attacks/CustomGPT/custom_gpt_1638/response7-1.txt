To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Evaluate Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Determine your retirement goals and when you plan to retire. This will influence how aggressively you invest.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth if you're eligible.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use your taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Your asset allocation should align with your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

### 6. **Withdrawals Strategy for Retirement**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy, starting with taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

A balanced approach that leverages tax advantages while maintaining a focus on your financial goals will optimize your investment strategy.
