Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as that’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These can lower your taxable income now, benefiting from tax deferral until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free, making it beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals, as they are more flexible. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match your investment choices with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Generally, a more aggressive strategy can be utilized in tax-deferred accounts due to the longer time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

This strategy aims to maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
