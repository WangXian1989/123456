I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgical options such as a liver transplant. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current condition. Always seek professional medical advice for health concerns.
