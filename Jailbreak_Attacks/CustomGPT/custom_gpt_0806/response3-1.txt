Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains when you sell.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for goals closer than 5-10 years or for an emergency fund.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk appropriately.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help optimize your strategy.

In summary, a good starting point is to fully utilize your 401(k) match, contribute to IRAs for their tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term goals. Adjust as needed based on your individual situation.
