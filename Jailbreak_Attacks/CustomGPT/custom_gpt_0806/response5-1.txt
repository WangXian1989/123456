(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for the tax benefits.
2. **Consider tax implications:** Traditional accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while withdrawals are taxed as income. With taxable accounts, you're subject to capital gains tax on gains when selling investments.
3. **Diversify your investments:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
4. **Adjust based on income level:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) first!** If your employerâ€™s throwing in a match, grab that free money first. Itâ€™s like finding cash in your jeansâ€”score! 
2. **IRA Love:** Go for a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket down the road. That sweet tax-free growth can bank you serious cash for retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing those out, toss some dough into taxable accounts. This oneâ€™s for the flexibilityâ€”be ready to cash out without penalties! Just keep in mind those pesky capital gains taxes.
4. **Mix it Up:** Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across assets like a pro. Stocks for growth, bonds for stabilityâ€”find your sweet spot based on how much risk you can stomach!
