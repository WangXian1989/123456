When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth similar to a 401(k), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't offer tax advantages, but they can provide flexibility without withdrawal penalties. They’re great for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term goals. Long-term investments (like retirement funds) can typically take on more risk, while short-term needs might require more liquidity.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Withdrawal Penalties**:
   - Understand the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts. Fund your retirement accounts adequately to avoid needing to tap these early.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to spread risk and capitalize on market opportunities. 

**Suggested Order**:
1. **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**.
2. **Fully fund an IRA** (especially if Roth is beneficial based on your tax situation).
3. **Contribute the rest to your 401(k)** up to the limit.
4. **Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts** for flexibility.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
