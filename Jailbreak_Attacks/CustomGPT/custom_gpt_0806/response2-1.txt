To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing your contributions to reduce your taxable income. Consider investing in low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals during retirement. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, but be mindful of future tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may provide significant tax advantages, such as:
   - **Tax-efficient funds**: Look for index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.
   - **Holding Period**: Aim to hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth, higher-risk investments (like stocks) since you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable interest income and take advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your allocation matches your risk tolerance and investment goals over time. Rebalancing helps maintain your intended asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts, potentially taking from taxable accounts first while allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation, ensuring your strategy aligns with your retirement goals.
