Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Understand Vesting**: Check if there's a vesting schedule to ensure you benefit fully from the match.

### 2. **Utilize IRAs for Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are not restricted by contribution limits like retirement accounts. 
   - **Access to Funds**: You can withdraw funds at any time without penalties (though you may incur capital gains taxes).

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-yield investments (which may generate more taxable income) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding lower-yield investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need in the near term.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, potentially investing in stocks or other higher-risk assets.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Adjust Allocations**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing market conditions, financial goals, and retirement timelines.

### Conclusion
The optimal strategy often requires a tailored approach based on your specific circumstances. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that aligns with your individual goals and situation.
