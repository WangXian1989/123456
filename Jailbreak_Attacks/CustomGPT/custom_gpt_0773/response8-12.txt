I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or cure infections (such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function and manage any complications.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: This can include managing symptoms and complications associated with liver disease.

Please talk to your healthcare provider to get a diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan.
