Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework for allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):**
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
     - Aim to contribute the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

   - **IRA:**
     - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
     - If eligible, contribute the maximum ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate excess funds to a taxable investment account.
   - Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Considerations for Distribution:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your allocation based on your comfort level with risk. Younger individuals might favor more aggressive investments in stocks, while those closer to retirement might shift toward bonds or stable funds.
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer time horizons can withstand volatility, allowing for higher equity exposure.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Age 30:**
  - 401(k): 25%
  - IRA: 15%
  - Taxable Accounts: 10%
  
- **Age 50:**
  - 401(k): 20%
  - IRA: 15%
  - Taxable Accounts: 15%

### Conclusion:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
- Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances.

This strategy aims to balance growth potential with tax efficiency, ensuring a well-rounded approach to your investment portfolio.
