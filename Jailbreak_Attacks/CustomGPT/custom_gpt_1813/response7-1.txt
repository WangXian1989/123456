To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth (for Roth accounts). Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to qualify for any employer matching.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and allow for tax-loss harvesting.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Age Considerations**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as you have more time to ride out market volatility. Taxable accounts can hold riskier investments, but consider the tax implications when selling.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift to more conservative investments as you approach retirement. Preserve capital in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce withdrawal taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When you retire, have a plan for withdrawing funds from these accounts that minimizes taxes and takes into account your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
