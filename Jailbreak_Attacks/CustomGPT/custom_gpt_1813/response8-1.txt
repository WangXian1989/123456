To distribute your money effectively amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts can benefit from a long-term investment strategy, focusing on growth through a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. You might want to lean more heavily toward equities in these accounts, given their tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as municipal bonds or tax-efficient funds. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income, so consider keeping higher-growth investments here.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If eligible, prioritize this for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Pay attention to tax implications when buying and selling investments. Focus on long-term capital gains for lower tax rates.

4. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals and when you plan to access the funds.
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for safer investments in taxable accounts or short-term bonds.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Review your portfolio allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts prematurely.
