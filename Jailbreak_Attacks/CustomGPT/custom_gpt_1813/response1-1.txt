To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantage:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Many employers match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No immediate tax benefits, but you can access money without penalties, and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon. If you're saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out your employerâ€™s 401(k) match and then consider the IRA.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties, which can be beneficial if you need funds before retirement.

5. **Investment Choices:**
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs. Look into the investment choices available in each account.

**Sample Distribution Strategy:**
- **Max out your 401(k) to get the full employer match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if you qualify) for tax-free growth.**
- **Use taxable accounts for additional savings or flexibility.**
