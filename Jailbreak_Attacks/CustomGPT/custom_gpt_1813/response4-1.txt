Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). If you can, aim to max out contributions.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your income and tax situation). This can provide additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you might need in the short term or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location:** Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax burden.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Decide your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally should be more heavily weighted in your 401(k) and IRA, while bonds can be allocated to your taxable account if you're looking for income.

### 4. **Future Withdrawals**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider how and when you will withdraw funds. IRAs and 401(k)s can have penalties for early withdrawal, so keep that in mind for short-term needs.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly**
   - **Performance Review:** Regularly check and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, then aim for 15-20% of your income if possible.
- **IRA:** Aim for the maximum allowable contribution.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate additional funds after ensuring the above accounts are funded.
