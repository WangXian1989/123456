To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages (traditional or Roth), with flexibility but lower contribution limits compared to 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest and withdraw with no restrictions, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) since itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to your taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - For higher income, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to lower taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth options where you pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains treatment.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can personalize your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that minimizes taxes and maximizes growth potential across your retirement and taxable accounts.
