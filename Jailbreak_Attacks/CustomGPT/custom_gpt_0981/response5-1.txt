(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) if available, as they often match a percentage of your contributions. Next, consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Finally, taxable accounts can be useful for flexibility and investing in a wider range of assets without restrictions on withdrawals. Diversification across these accounts can help with both tax efficiency and investment growth.
