(α) The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally speaking, it's wise to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here’s a common approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any additional funds can be invested in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, but keep in mind they are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

Review your financial goals and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice!
