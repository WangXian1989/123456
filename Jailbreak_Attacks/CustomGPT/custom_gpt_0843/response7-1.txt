The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the specific features of each account type. Here are some general guidelines to consider for allocating your investments:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. In 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that are likely to be taxed at favorable long-term capital gains rates or for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds). Remember that selling stocks held for more than a year will typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider your overall asset allocation strategy (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.) and ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about your anticipated withdrawal strategy. Retirees might want to consider which account to withdraw from first based on tax implications. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and IRA last.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and performance. Adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always remember that investment strategies should be tailored to your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and circumstances.
