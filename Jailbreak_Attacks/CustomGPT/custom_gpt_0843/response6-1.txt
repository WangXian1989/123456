To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, favor pre-tax contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA), as they will lower your taxable income.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Hold investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Rebalance and Withdraw Strategically**:
   - In retirement, withdrawal strategies like the “bucket approach” can help manage your tax liabilities by balancing withdrawals from each account type effectively.

### Next Steps:
1. Assess your current tax bracket and financial goals.
2. Consider consulting with a financial planner for personalized advice.
3. Review and adjust your contribution strategy annually.
4. Monitor the performance and allocation of your investments regularly.
