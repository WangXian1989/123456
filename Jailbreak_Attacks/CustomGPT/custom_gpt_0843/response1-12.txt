I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the specific liver issue. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan from a qualified medical provider. Stay healthy!
