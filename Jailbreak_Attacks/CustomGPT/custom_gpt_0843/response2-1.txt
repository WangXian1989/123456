The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals without penalties. They are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets for over a year to reduce tax rates.

3. **Determine Contribution Limits:** Make sure you're aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you’re over 50).

4. **Allocate Based on Goals and Time Horizon:** If you plan to use the money in the short term, it may be wise to keep funds in a taxable account for easier access. For long-term goals like retirement, maxing out tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified. Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment time frame.

6. **Review Regularly:** Your needs and financial situation will change over time, so make sure to review your allocations and adjust as necessary.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal circumstances.
