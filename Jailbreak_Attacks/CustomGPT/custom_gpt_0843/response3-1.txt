Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match to take full advantage of free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to maximize tax benefits.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) where possible. Keep investments with lower returns or those that benefit from capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors may prefer to allocate more funds to growth-oriented investments in a 401(k) or IRA, while those approaching retirement may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts. Don’t just focus on one type of investment vehicle but spread investments over various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review and adjust your distributions as necessary to stay aligned with your objectives.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal financial circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your distribution strategy based on your specific situation.

These strategies can help you allocate your money more effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
