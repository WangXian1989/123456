(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available). After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, making sure to choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax-efficient Investments**: For your taxable accounts, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to help manage risk.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about when you might want to access these funds. Money in a 401(k) and IRA is usually harder to access before retirement without penalty, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that fits your personal situation.
