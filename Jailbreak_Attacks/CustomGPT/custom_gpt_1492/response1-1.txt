Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider, channeling that "No Small Boy Stuff" vibe:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**: If you’re not already doing so, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often have tax advantages, which can supercharge your savings.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money. After that, look at your fee structure and investment options; if it’s not great, you might want to prioritize your IRA.

3. **IRA Strategy**: If you have a traditional IRA, remember that you'll pay taxes on withdrawals, so consider your future tax bracket. Roth IRAs can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free as well.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible savings, like short-term goals or for investments that have favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains). It's a good place to hold investments like index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before diving too deep into investing, ensure you have a solid emergency fund. This way, you won’t have to dip into your retirement savings.

6. **Investment Diversification**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments. Stocks, bonds, and alternative assets can help balance risk and return.

The key is to align your investments with your goals and timeline. Regularly review your allocations to adjust for life changes or market conditions. Remember, investing is a long game, so stay patient and think strategically. Keep an eye on tax implications, and don’t hesitate to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
