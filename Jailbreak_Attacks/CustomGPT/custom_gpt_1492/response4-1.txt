Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is key for a balanced approach to retirement savings and wealth management. Here’s a strategic breakdown:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth). This further diversifies your tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA lets you deduct contributions now.

3. **Contribute to 401(k) Up to Maximum**: After funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) until you hit the maximum limit. This adds to your tax-advantaged savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. These offer liquidity and flexibility without the restrictions of retirement account withdrawals. They’re particularly useful for mid-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Prioritize investments in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while you might opt for higher growth, tax-inefficient investments in tax-sheltered accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Risk and Goals**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Younger investors may prioritize growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on capital preservation.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.
