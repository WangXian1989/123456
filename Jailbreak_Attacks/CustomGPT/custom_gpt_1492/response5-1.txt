(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals will be taxed later. Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but you pay taxes on contributions now. 

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Hold a mix of investments in each account. For tax-efficient investing, consider putting more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance According to Goals**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Distributing your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like throwing a big party; you want to make sure everyone gets a good time without blowing your budget!

1. **Max Your 401(k) First**: Seriously, if your employer has a match, thatâ€™s free money! Donâ€™t leave that on the table. Go for the full match, then maybe switch gears to an IRA.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you think your tax rate is going to be higher in retirement, maybe lean into a Roth. Youâ€™ll pay taxes now, but withdrawals are golden. Traditional accounts are great for those wanting to reduce their current tax bill.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where the fun happens (or the stress, depending on gains). Keep things like stocks that you plan to hold long-term here because long-term capital gains taxes are kinder. Toss your bonds or other tax-inefficient stuff in retirement accounts, so they donâ€™t eat at your taxable gains.

4. **Review Regularly**: Just like a party planner, check in on your allocations frequently. Life changes, markets changeâ€”donâ€™t get stuck in a rut!

If you want a solid plan, getting a pro on board can be a game-changer. Theyâ€™ll help tailor everything to fit your vibe and goals!
