When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to keep in mind, infused with that "My First Million" energy:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**: Focus on contributing as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts often provide tax advantages, whether through tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially "free" money and a solid return on your investment.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here might not have the same tax benefits but offer flexibility and access without penalties.

4. **Asset Location**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that generate little taxable income) in your taxable accounts, while keeping higher-yielding investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investment choices are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and potential returns. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary, especially as market conditions change.

7. **Long-term Focus**: Stay committed to your strategy for the long term. Short-term market fluctuations can be tempting to react to, but a steady approach tends to yield better results.

Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works for you. Keep that "Manifest Cowboy" mindset as you build a robust financial future!
