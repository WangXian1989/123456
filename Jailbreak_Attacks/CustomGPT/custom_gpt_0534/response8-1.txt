To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions since these are also tax-advantaged.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income, providing an immediate tax benefit. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals at any time without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for more tax-efficient investments. Generally, higher-growth investments (like stocks) can be suitable for 401(k) and IRAs, while more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.
   - Consider keeping dividend-paying stocks and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes and sectors to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your retirement goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals according to the type of account. Knowing how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds can help you optimize your tax situation in retirement.

Before making any decisions, it often makes sense to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
