The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. These contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **After Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, redirect additional funds to taxable accounts. This is particularly useful if you plan to access funds before retirement age, as you’ll face penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Investment Flexibility**: $$ funds in taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in investments and withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and goals, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets accordingly.

6. **Stay Informed on Tax Implications**: Plan for the tax implications of your withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your situation, it might make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first.

7. **Adjust Annually**: Review and adjust your contributions and allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

Ultimately, a diversified approach that emphasizes tax efficiency while meeting your financial goals will likely serve you best. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your unique situation.
