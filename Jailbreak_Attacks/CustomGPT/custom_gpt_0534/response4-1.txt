To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be a great place for pre-tax dollars.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (provided certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money here is subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold for a profit. The interest and dividends are also taxed annually.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). 

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term goals. If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, prioritize tax-efficient investment in taxable accounts. 

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across your accounts to manage risk. You can hold more aggressive investments in a taxable account (to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting) and more stable investments in retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw from each account in retirement, which can impact your tax liability. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Max out 401(k) contributions** first to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- If possible, **contribute to an IRA**, particularly if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it offers long-term tax advantages.
- Use any remaining funds to invest in **taxable accounts**.

### Sample Allocation:

Assuming you have a total of $10,000 to invest:
- 401(k): $5,000 (max for employer match)
- IRA: $3,000 (contribution for the year)
- Taxable Account: $2,000 (remaining funds)

### Revisit Your Strategy:
It's essential to review your distribution strategy regularly, especially as tax laws change or your financial goals evolve.
