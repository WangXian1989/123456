Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions next (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed (for traditional accounts).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. However, you have flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth through diversified funds (like target-date funds).
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k), but consider including alternative investments if allowed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Here, you may want to invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside of your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Regular Reviews**: Monitor and adjust your allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Up to match + a percentage of your salary.
- **IRA:** Full contribution limit (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
