Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and minimize tax liabilities. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing the above accounts, invest in a taxable account. Use this for investments you might need before retirement, as it offers more flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider higher-growth assets (stocks) since you won’t need these funds for a long time.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and your changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also be valuable.
