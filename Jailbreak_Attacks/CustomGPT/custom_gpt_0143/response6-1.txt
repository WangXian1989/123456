Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing 401(k) contributions (up to the limit), consider a Roth or traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that produce capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth strategies (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a diversified mix but may include more conservative investments for liquidity.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on changes in market conditions, your income, and goal timelines.

### Key Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might prefer aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement may prioritize stability.
- **Financial Goals**: Short-term goals might influence how much is kept in taxable accounts vs. retirement accounts.
