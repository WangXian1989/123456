To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following recommendations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contribute enough to maximize any employer match:** This is essentially "free money" and should be your priority.
   - **Consider high-growth investments:** Since taxes are deferred until withdrawal, you can afford to invest in higher-risk, higher-reward options.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Utilize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth:** If you qualify, consider prioritizing Roth contributions. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Use this account for a mix of assets, balancing between bonds and stocks based on your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest in tax-efficient funds:** Look for index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.
   - **Consider municipal bonds:** These provide tax-free interest rate income, which can be an effective strategy in a taxable account.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Prioritize contributions based on tax advantages:** Generally, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in taxable accounts.
- **Adjust your portfolio according to your time horizon:** Younger investors often favor growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

### **Rating: 8/10**
- This strategy is moderately effective, offering a blend of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity through taxable accounts. Individual circumstances may influence personal preferences.

Always assess your individual situation, including tax brackets and financial goals, to make the best distribution decision.
