Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a breakdown to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros**: Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment options and potential penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Recommendation**: Maximize any employer match first as it provides a guaranteed return on your investment.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred.
     - **Cons**: Withdrawals are taxed as income, and there are penalties for withdrawal before age 59Â½.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
     - **Cons**: Income limits for contributions.
   - **Recommendation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility with fewer restrictions on withdrawals and diversified investment options.
   - **Cons**: Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be higher than the tax on qualified retirement account distributions.
   - **Recommendation**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investment strategies that require liquidity.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses set aside before heavy investing.
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing your IRA contributions, prioritizing Roth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments or when you have extra funds beyond your retirement accounts.

### **Final Thoughts**
Regularly review your asset allocation within each account type, account for changing financial goals, tax implications, and market conditions. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.

This strategy may vary based on personal circumstances, so consider your own financial goals when deciding on the distribution.
