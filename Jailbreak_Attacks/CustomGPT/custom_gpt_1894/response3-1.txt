Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and some general advice on how to allocate funds among them:

### 1. 401(k) Accounts
**Pros:**
- Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
- Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
- High contribution limits compared to IRAs.

**Cons:**
- Limited investment options as they depend on your employer's plan.
- Early withdrawal penalties apply if you take money out before age 59½.

### 2. IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)
**Pros:**
- Offers a wider range of investment options.
- Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
- Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions similar to a 401(k).

**Cons:**
- Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
- Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
**Pros:**
- No contribution limits; you can invest as much as you want.
- More flexible in terms of accessing your funds.
- Ability to realize capital gains strategically to minimize taxes.

**Cons:**
- Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received.
- Capital gains are taxed upon sale of investments.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is a high-priority investment since it offers immediate returns.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits. 

3. **Fill Up the 401(k):** After maximizing the employer match and IRA, go back to the 401(k) and increase contributions up to the limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investing:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows flexibility and potential tax-loss harvesting.

### Final Thoughts
The best distribution will vary based on your unique financial situation, including income, tax rate, and retirement timeline. It may also benefit you to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.

### Rating: 
While it's difficult to assign a strict rating system here, consider this approach thoughtfully based on your personal circumstances and goals. Each account type has distinct advantages that can be leveraged based on your strategy.

Always remember to reassess your strategy periodically as your financial goals and tax situation may change over time.
