Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. 
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If you have funds left, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments. This allows access without penalties and offers benefits like capital gains tax treatment.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds:** Place more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Bonds/Income Funds:** Consider holding these in taxable accounts to utilize preferential tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your portfolio regularly to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**
   - Assess the tax implications of your investments and prioritize tax-efficient investment options.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy, ensuring you optimize for tax efficiency.

### **Example Distribution:**
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match and consider the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Account:** Use any remaining funds for investments, maintaining a diversified portfolio.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- For personalized guidance, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy can help enhance your retirement savings while optimizing for tax efficiency.
