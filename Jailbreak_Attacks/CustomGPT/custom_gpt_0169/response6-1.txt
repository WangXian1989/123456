Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k)s and traditional IRAs to defer taxes. Withdraw during retirement when you might be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments while avoiding penalties on early withdrawals.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for compound growth over time.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Adjust allocations based on account type to manage risk and returns effectively.

### Summary
- **Start with 401(k) contributions** for matching.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** for tax advantages.
- Use **taxable accounts** for flexibility and diversification.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
