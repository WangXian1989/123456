The best way to distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for high contribution limits and tax deferral. Choose a mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront. Aim to max out contributions here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with lower tax implications. Focus on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio within each account to spread risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will draw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liability effectively.
