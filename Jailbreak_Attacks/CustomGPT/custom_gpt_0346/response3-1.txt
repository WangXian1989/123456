Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner.

### 2. Utilize Employer Match
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

### 3. Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **IRA**: After 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA. There are two types:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 4. Consider Your Tax Situation
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends subject to lower tax rates.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.

### 5. Monitor Your Asset Allocation
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. Regular Rebalancing
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider other options.
- **IRA**: Max out if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Support ongoing expenses or investments and any excess after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
The best strategy involves a mix that aligns with your long-term financial goals while maximizing tax advantages. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
