To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here due to potential employer matches and tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Max out a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth; otherwise, prioritize traditional IRAs for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure varied asset allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk while achieving returns.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for future withdrawals strategically; consider which funds to draw from first to minimize tax liabilities.

Regularly review and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.
