I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition. Generally, they may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Adopt a liver-friendly diet (low fat, high in fruits and vegetables).
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications for fatty liver disease.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-ups with your doctor for liver function tests.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek personalized advice from your healthcare provider.
