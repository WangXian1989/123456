Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:**
   - After maxing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth and potential matched contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for greater flexibility with withdrawals before retirement age and can be beneficial for long-term capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon within each account. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to take advantage of tax-free compounding.

6. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review your allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific income, retirement goals, and tax situation.
