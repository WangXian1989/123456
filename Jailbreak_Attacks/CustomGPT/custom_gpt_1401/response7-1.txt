Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be beneficial for tax deductions.

### 3. **Build a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or expenses to avoid penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 6. **Monitor Withdrawals Post-Retirement**
   - Strategically withdraw from accounts to minimize taxes, considering the order of withdrawals (e.g., living off taxable accounts first).

Balancing these elements can help you create an effective strategy tailored to your financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
