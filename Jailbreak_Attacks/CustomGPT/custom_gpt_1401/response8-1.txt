To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Make the maximum allowable contribution to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Depending on your current tax situation and expected retirement tax bracket, either a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) may be beneficial.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount annually.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investment diversification and to hold investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Consider keeping some cash on hand in a taxable account for liquidity needs or unexpected expenses.

### General Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio by adjusting the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Retirement Timeline**: Align your contributions and withdrawals with your expected retirement timeline. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first in early retirement.
- **Review Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
