Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - *Traditional IRA*: Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - *Roth IRA*: Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and investing in assets with favorable capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, focus on a diversified mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **Stocks**: Higher potential growth, suitable for long-term investment.
   - **Bonds**: More stable, can provide income and reduce overall risk.
   - **Real Estate or Alternatives**: Consider for diversification.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice is crucial, especially for complex financial situations.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
