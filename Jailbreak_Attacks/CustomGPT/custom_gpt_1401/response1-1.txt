Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before anything else. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement or for flexibility. They don't have the same tax advantages, but you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Consider how you allocate investments across these accounts. For longer-term growth, you might opt for stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to mitigate tax on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can be invaluable, especially for complex situations.

Always ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
