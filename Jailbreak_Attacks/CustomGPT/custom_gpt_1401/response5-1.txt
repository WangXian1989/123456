(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if possible.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs). Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: If you might need to access funds before retirement, keep some investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified. This means spreading out your investments across different asset classes within each account.

5. **Review Regularly**: Re-evaluate your distribution strategy periodically as your financial situation changes.

1. **401(k) First**: Start by throwing as much as you can into that 401(k), especially if your employer matches. Itâ€™s free cashâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **IRA Action**: After you've maxed out the freebie, hit your IRA hard. With a traditional IRA, you can defer those taxes; with a Roth, you can dodge them entirely later. Choose based on whether you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket now or in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Pour some cash into those taxable accounts but be smart. Invest in stuff thatâ€™s tax-efficientâ€”like index funds or solid stocksâ€”so your tax bill doesnâ€™t skyrocket, and keep more yielding stuff in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Stay Liquid**: If you think you'll need cash before retirement, keep a chunk in those taxable accountsâ€”better to have the flexibility!

5. **Keep Checking**: The financial world changes, and so will your needs. Reassess your strategy every year or so to keep on top of your game!

Now go out there and make those dollars work for you! ðŸ’¸
