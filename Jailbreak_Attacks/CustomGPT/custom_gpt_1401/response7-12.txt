I'm not able to provide personal medical advice, but I can tell you that treatment options for liver problems often include:

- **Lifestyle changes**: Diet modifications, hydration, and avoiding alcohol can be beneficial.
- **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes may be prescribed.
- **Regular monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to assess the condition.
- **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
