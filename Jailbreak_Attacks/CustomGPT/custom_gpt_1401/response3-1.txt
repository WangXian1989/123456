Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**:
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each type of account, consider the appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance, changes in goals, or changes in tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

This approach helps optimize your tax situation and supports your overall financial goals.
