To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then focus on your IRA. If you can max out your contributions to these accounts, do so before investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Use IRAs for Growth Investments**: Place higher-growth investments in your IRA to avoid taxes on capital gains. 

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Avoid doubling down on the same asset class across accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Withdrawal Timing**: Consider how and when you plan to access these funds. For instance, taxable accounts might be preferable for short-term needs to avoid penalties on retirement accounts.
  
4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k) plans and IRAs to maximize the benefits of these accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice based on your financial situation can optimize your strategy.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and aligning your investments with your overall financial goals, you can create an effective strategy to distribute your money wisely.
