When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Tax Implications  
- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Withdrawals taxed at retirement income rate.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Income generated here is taxed annually at capital gains rates.

### 2. Optimize Contributions  
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer matchâ€”it's free money.
- **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your current vs. future tax bracket, choose the appropriate IRA type.

### 3. Diversify Investments  
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash in each account type suitable to your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Appropriately**: Regularly adjust ownership percentages to maintain targeted risk levels. 

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy  
- **Order of Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor  
- Professional advice can provide personalized strategies that align with your financial goals and tax situation.

By employing these strategies, you can smartly grow and protect your wealth across different account types.
