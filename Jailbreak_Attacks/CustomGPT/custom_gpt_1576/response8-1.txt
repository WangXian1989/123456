Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contributions and can only choose from limited investments, prioritize this account early.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA, considering a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. The tax-free growth can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts. These accounts can offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes on interest) and stocks in taxable accounts (to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates).

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your investment strategy regularly, adjusting based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
