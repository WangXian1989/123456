Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: Consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after receiving your employer match. Roth IRAs can be great if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a savings account before significantly investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is good for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
