I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, weight management, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In some cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even transplantation could be considered. Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
