To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferrals or tax-free growth.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility**: Keep investments in taxable accounts that generate capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income from 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Allocate based on goals**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings and investments that you won't need access to until retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts for short-term goals**: Reserve taxable accounts for medium-term financial goals, allowing for easier access without penalties.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Type**:
   - **Consider risk levels**: Allocate riskier investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on higher returns.
   - **Stabilize income**: Place more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax treatment on qualified dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan withdrawals**: In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize your tax burden, potentially drawing first from taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

By understanding the specific features and benefits of each account type, you can optimize your financial distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
