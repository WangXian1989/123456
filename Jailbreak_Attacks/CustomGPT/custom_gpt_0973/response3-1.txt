The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some steps to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Assess Income and Tax Bracket**: Determine your current income and the tax bracket you fall into. This will influence how you choose to allocate funds.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction while Roth IRAs grow tax-free upon withdrawal.
   
3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.
   - For short-term goals, you might want to keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. This includes stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix of accounts allows for flexibility in managing taxes during retirement.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions will change over time, so revisit your allocation strategy regularly.

In conclusion, a common approach is to prioritize funding your 401(k) to the match level, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
