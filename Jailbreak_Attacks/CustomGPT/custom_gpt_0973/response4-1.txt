Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA/ROTH IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down as it may provide a better return than investing.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, providing tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing investments that generate high levels of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy across all accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals.
