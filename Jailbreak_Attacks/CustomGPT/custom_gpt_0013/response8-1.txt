To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Know the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500, while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Taxable accounts have no contribution limits but consider tax implications.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on your IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: A good choice for high-income earners because contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), lowering current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if you qualify). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Diversify Investment Options**: Consider using your 401(k) for broader market investments with lower fees and your IRA for more specialized investments (like cryptocurrencies or international stocks) that may not be available in your 401(k). Use taxable accounts for investments like ETFs or index funds that are tax-efficient.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds. Avoid high-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: When drawing from these accounts in retirement, consider starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Draw from the 401(k) or IRA later to manage tax brackets effectively.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Life circumstances and tax laws change, so regularly reassess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.
