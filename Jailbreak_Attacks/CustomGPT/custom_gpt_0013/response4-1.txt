To provide tailored suggestions for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, Iâ€™d like to clarify a few details:

1. **Investment Goals**: What are your main objectives for saving and investing? (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education)
   
2. **Retirement Age**: At what age do you plan to retire?
   
3. **Risk Tolerance**: How comfortable are you with market fluctuations? 

4. **Current Contributions**: Are you maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA? 

5. **Time Horizon**: How long do you plan to keep your money invested before you need to access it?

Once you provide these details, I'll be able to offer more specific advice on how to distribute your assets effectively.
