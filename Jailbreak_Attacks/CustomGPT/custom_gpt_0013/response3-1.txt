To provide tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here is a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are: 
   - 401(k): $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50).
   - IRA: $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50).

3. **Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw the money in retirement.
   - Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy:
   - If you have a long time horizon (10+ years), consider a stock-heavy allocation for growth in your retirement accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house), keep a balanced and conservative approach in your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment grows, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all account types.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized planning that considers your entire financial situation and specific goals, consider consulting with a certified financial advisor.

By examining these factors, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes the benefits of each account type while aligning with your overall financial goals.
