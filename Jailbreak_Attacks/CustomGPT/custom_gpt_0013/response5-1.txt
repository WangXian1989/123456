(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, consider maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if they offer matching contributions. After that, you can contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Finally, any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution to your specific circumstances.
