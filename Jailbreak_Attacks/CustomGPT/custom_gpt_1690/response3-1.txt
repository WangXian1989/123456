To address your question on distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and offers tax advantages.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: If you have a Traditional IRA, similar tax rules apply. If it’s a Roth IRA, contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and other taxes on income, which could be higher than tax rates for your retirement accounts.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: The longer your investments can grow, the more beneficial it is to use tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. If you’re several decades from retirement, maximizing contributions to these accounts might be a priority.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Riskier investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawals to minimize tax impact. For instance, you might want to withdraw from your taxable account first during retirement to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Adjust Based on Income Changes**: Monitor your income level and adjust your contributions accordingly. In years of higher income, consider maxing out tax-advantaged contributions.

For tailored advice, it would be beneficial to analyze your specific financial situation, including your income, tax rate, and retirement goals. If you’d like resources on the different types of accounts or investment strategies, let me know!
