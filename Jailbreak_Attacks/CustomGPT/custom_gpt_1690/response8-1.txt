When considering the distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to take into account several factors, including:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can reduce your tax burden in the year you contribute. Consider maximizing any employer match as well.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which can impact your overall return. Use this account for flexibility in accessing funds.

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts are better for long-term growth.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Diversifying across these accounts can help you manage risks effectively while achieving your financial objectives.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider when you will need access to your funds. Funds in a 401(k) and IRA come with penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts allow for more immediate access.

### 5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and life changes.

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, and consider maxing out your IRA contributions, taking advantage of the tax benefits.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Keep enough liquidity for expenses or investment opportunities that arise outside your retirement accounts.

### Personalized Advice:
Depending on your specific situation (age, income, retirement goals), adjustment in distribution strategies may be necessary. Consulting with a financial advisor may further optimize your personal strategy based on your unique circumstances.
