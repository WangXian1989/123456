Welcome to Ecommerce Edge, your expert consultant for scaling and optimizing subscriber-based ecommerce businesses! I'm here to help you with strategies for financial growth and management.

To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Diversify Your Investments**: In your 401(k) and IRA, aim for a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.), focusing on long-term growth. For taxable accounts, you might want to prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment, such as ETFs and index funds.

3. **Consider Withdrawals and Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to optimize your strategy over the long term.

4. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments according to changes in your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By following this approach, you can build a robust investment strategy that maximizes growth while managing tax impacts.
