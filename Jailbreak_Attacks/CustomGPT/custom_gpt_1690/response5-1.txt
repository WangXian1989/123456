(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, a well-balanced approach is suggested:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum limit if you're able to.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but recognize the potential tax implications from capital gains.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! To distribute your cash like a pro amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider this funky formula: 

1. **401(k)**: First things first, squeeze every bit of that employer match in your 401(k)! Thatâ€™s free money, baby! Then, if you can, max it out. After all, the more you shove into this pre-tax account, the less you're taxed now, and it grows tax-deferred. 

2. **IRA**: Next up, tackle the IRA! If you can swing it, throw some cash into a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free withdrawals in retirement are like the Holy Grail! If your income is too high for a Roth, the traditional IRA is your next best bet with tax deductions. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've hit the limits on the above, itâ€™s time to play in the taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, but watch out for the tax man when you sell! But hey, you might also want to invest in low-turnover funds to keep taxes at bay. 

Long story short, max out those tax-advantaged accounts first, and then have a little fun in the taxable playground. Just ensure you donâ€™t ignore your cash flow needs and risk tolerance while you're at it! And hey, always chat with a financial guru for the nitty-gritty personal advice!
