Welcome to Ecommerce Edge, your expert consultant for scaling and optimizing subscriber-based ecommerce businesses! While your question pertains to investment strategies rather than ecommerce, I can provide a general approach to help you think through your distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, including retirement age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. This will influence how you allocate funds.

2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match as it’s essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: For 2023, consider contributing to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these if you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you want more liquidity.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance irrespective of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.
