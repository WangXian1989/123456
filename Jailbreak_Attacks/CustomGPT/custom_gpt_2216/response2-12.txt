I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about liver treatment options. The best treatment will depend on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.

4. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver detoxification or even liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: 
   - Manage symptoms and complications with supportive therapies.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition.
