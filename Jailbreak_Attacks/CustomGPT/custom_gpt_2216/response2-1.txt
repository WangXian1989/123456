Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial objectives, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Next, consider the IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax strategy). If qualifying for a Roth IRA, it can be a valuable long-term tax-free growth option.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if you have not yet reached the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you still have funds to invest after maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Analyze your current and expected future tax bracket. Tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and IRAs lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to cover unexpected expenses before fully investing in these accounts.

7. **Balance and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your investment distributions to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
