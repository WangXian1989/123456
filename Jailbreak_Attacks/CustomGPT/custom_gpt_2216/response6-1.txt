The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **401(k)**
     - **Match First**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**
     - **Tax Advantages**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - **Flexibility**: Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

### 2. Diversification:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Strategy**:
     - **Aggressive Growth**: Higher allocation in stocks for long-term growth, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Fixed Income**: Consider placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 3. Tax Considerations:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxable events. 
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan withdrawals based on tax implications, typically taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. Review Regularly:
   - **Adjust Based on Goals**: Regularly review and adjust allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Summary:
- Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans.
- Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
- Be strategic about asset placement based on tax efficiency. 

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
