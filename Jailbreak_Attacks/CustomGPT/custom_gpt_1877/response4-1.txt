Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a high tax bracket now, max out contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers a limited number of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs if available.
   - **IRA:** More flexibility in investment choices, consider diversifying into stocks, bonds, or other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes, consider municipal bonds for tax-free income.

### 4. **Withdrawals and Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, consider keeping some liquid assets here for emergencies or short-term expenses.
   - Keep track of retirement account withdrawal rules to avoid penalties.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically evaluate and rebalance your accounts based on market performance and changing life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of income to reach employer match, then max contributions if possible.
- **IRA:** Max annual contribution to IRA (traditional or Roth based on your situation).
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
This multi-faceted strategy aims to maximize your savings while considering future tax implications and withdrawal requirements. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
