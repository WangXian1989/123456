Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider capital gains tax implications when investing in taxable accounts; holding investments long-term can be more tax-efficient.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of diversified funds (e.g., index funds, target-date funds) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategy as your 401(k) but can include more variety, especially in a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more aggressive investments since you may have a longer time horizon. This can include stocks or ETFs that youâ€™re comfortable holding longer to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Annual Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
The best strategy involves a balanced approach, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and using taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your investment choices to your financial goals and preferred risk level.
