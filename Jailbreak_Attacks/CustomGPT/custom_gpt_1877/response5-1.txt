To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth, taxes due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Fund IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Allocate investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts. Keep lower growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

Implementing these strategies can help you maximize your retirement savings potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
