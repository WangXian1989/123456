Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Some employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. Capital gains tax applies only when investments are sold.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is typically the first priority.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Use tax-advantaged accounts first**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before transferring funds to taxable accounts. This helps minimize taxes and takes advantage of tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: In taxable accounts, favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 4. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. long-term needs**: If you have short-term goals (e.g., buying a home), you may need liquidity that taxable accounts provide. If your focus is on retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRAs.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments in each account reflect a balanced strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may mean holding different types of assets across your accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation and respond to market changes.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full match (lets say 5-10% of your income).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (for 2023, $6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing the above accounts.

### Conclusion
Your ideal distribution depends on personal circumstances and long-term goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and to navigate changing tax laws effectively. Adjust your contributions as your income and financial circumstances change over time.
