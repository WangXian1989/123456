To strategically distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax advantages vary; Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are taxed upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; capital gains tax applies.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRA**: If eligible for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing this for tax-free growth. If not, traditional IRAs are a solid choice.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for extra savings once retirement accounts are maximized.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth due to their tax benefits.
   - **Balance Investments**: Keep in mind the capital gains in taxable accounts; consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Annual Assessments**: Reassess your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or investment goals.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and achieve your financial objectives.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded strategy involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, while keeping enough liquidity in taxable accounts for unforeseen expenses or opportunities. Regularly review your allocations to align with your evolving financial goals.
