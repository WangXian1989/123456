To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) in tax treatment; however, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial for younger individuals or those expecting higher tax rates in retirement.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Invest in higher growth or more volatile assets (e.g., stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Place assets here that are expected to appreciate significantly for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate tax-advantaged income (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends) or cash reserve needs, since investments can be sold to access cash without penalties.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Timeline and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might focus on aggressive growth, prioritizing stocks in tax-advantaged accounts. Those closer to retirement may want to protect capital and generate income, adjusting their asset allocations accordingly.

### 6. **Consider Your Overall Financial Goals**
   - Have clear short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals. Your investment strategy should align with these.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly (at least annually) and adjust based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Make individualized decisions based on your financial situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice. This holistic approach will help maximize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
