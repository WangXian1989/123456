(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, it might be beneficial to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to an IRA, which can provide tax benefits depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Any additional savings could then be allocated to your taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but don't have the same tax advantages. It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's best for you.
