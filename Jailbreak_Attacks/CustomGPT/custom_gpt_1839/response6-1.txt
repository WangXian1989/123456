To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce current taxable income.
   - Consider your tax bracket when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more to aggressive investments in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep more liquid, conservative investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs or expenses.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide based on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain cash or short-term investments in taxable accounts for emergencies.
- **Diversification**: Keep a diversified mix of assets across all account types to mitigate risk.

Utilizing these approaches will help optimize your overall financial strategy.
