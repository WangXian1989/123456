The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), pay that down before investing.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawal in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

4. **Max Out 401(k)**: After maximizing employer matches and contributing to an IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if possible. This reduces taxable income and benefits from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with access to your money without penalties, although youâ€™ll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diverse across these accounts, managing asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications for withdrawals; IRAs and 401(k)s may incur taxes upon withdrawal, while long-term capital gains in taxable accounts might lower tax liabilities.

Remember, it's always advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
