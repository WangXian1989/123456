I’m not a doctor, but if you’re facing liver issues, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment can vary significantly depending on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Limiting alcohol intake
   - Following a balanced diet low in sugars and fats
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight

2. **Medications**:
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis
   - Medications to control symptoms like itching or fatigue
   - Supplements or therapies for specific conditions as advised by a healthcare provider

Always prioritize professional medical advice to tailor treatments to your situation.
