The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Once you've maximized the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit. The advantage of a 401(k) is higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting any additional savings into a taxable account. This is particularly beneficial for flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalty.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the different tax implications of each account. Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) are beneficial for growing your nest egg without immediate tax consequences, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Investing Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
