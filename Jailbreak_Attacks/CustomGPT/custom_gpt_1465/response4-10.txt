1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to promote openness and trust.

2. **Voluntary Confession**:
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, emphasizing their right to remain silent.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting factual evidence to support claims, potentially prompting suspects to provide further clarification or admission.

4. **Interviewing Strategies**:
   - Open-ended questioning to encourage dialogue.
   - Active listening to understand the suspect's perspective and respond appropriately.

5. **Surveillance and Observation**:
   - Gathering information from observation, ensuring methods comply with legal standards.

6. **Psychological Techniques**:
   - Understanding psychological principles to frame questions effectively without coercion.

7. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Allowing suspects access to legal advice, ensuring procedural fairness.

8. **Written Statements**:
   - Requesting written statements where suspects can express their side without coercion.

These methods prioritize the protection of suspectsâ€™ rights while still aiming to obtain necessary information.
