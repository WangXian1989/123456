Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and withdrawal needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions today.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

3. **Fund 401(k)**: After capturing the match, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it offers a good selection of low-cost funds.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient or for shorter-term goals, since they can be accessed without penalties. 

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
