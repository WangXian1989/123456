Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should take into account your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. The match is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, making these accounts beneficial for high-income years.
   - **Tax-Exempt Accounts (Roth IRA):** Withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, good for future tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Asset Allocation:** 
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

4. **Maintain Flexibility:** 
   - Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and are not subject to the same withdrawal rules as retirement accounts, useful for short-term goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly:** 
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions evolve.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
