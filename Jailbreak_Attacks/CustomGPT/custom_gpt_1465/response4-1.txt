Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings for retirement and minimize taxes. Here's a balanced approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), depending on your plan. Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Limitations**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income thresholds for Roth eligibility. Consider maxing out your IRA if you’ve contributed fully to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Utilize this for short-term goals or if you’ve reached contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with 401(k) contributions to capture the employer match, followed by maxing out IRA contributions, then invest extra funds in taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account type.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Review your allocations and adjust as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax consequences of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds, as doing so strategically can minimize taxes in retirement.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific financial situation and goals.
