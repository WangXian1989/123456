Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options and can offer tax advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be directed to taxable accounts. These are beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies since they provide more liquidity.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where you hold certain investments. For example, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
