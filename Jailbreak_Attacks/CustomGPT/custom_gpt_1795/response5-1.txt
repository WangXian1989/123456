Before I provide any suggestions, could you please clarify your financial situation? Specifically, it would help to know:

1. Your age and retirement timeline.
2. Your income level and tax bracket.
3. Any employer match available for your 401(k).
4. Your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Also, feel free to share any additional context or documents that might help me understand your situation better!
