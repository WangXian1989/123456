It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among your retirement and investment accounts! The best strategy can vary based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in an easily accessible emergency fund.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out your employer's match, then consider the maximum contribution limits. This is beneficial for higher income earners due to pre-tax contributions which can lower taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can be allocated to taxable investment accounts. This offers flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regular Review**: Annually review your allocation and rebalance your portfolio as necessary based on performance, contributions, and changes in your goals or risk tolerance.
