The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income. Additionally, some employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs differ, and maxing out employer matches in a 401(k) is often recommended before contributing to IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Taxable accounts can be more suitable for short-term investments due to their liquidity, while retirement accounts are better for long-term growth.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when deciding how to allocate funds.

4. **Withdrawal Needs**: 
   - If you anticipate needing to access your money before retirement, it's crucial to invest more in taxable accounts, as both 401(k) and IRA accounts have penalties for early withdrawal (with some exceptions).

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxable income.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Consideration of State Taxes**: If you reside in a state with no income tax, you might prioritize taxable accounts since you wonâ€™t be penalized with state taxes on withdrawals.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified investment portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk.

A well-rounded distribution strategy could involve maxing out any available employer matches in your 401(k), contributing to an IRA, and then investing in a taxable account. However, since personal financial situations vary greatly, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is recommended.
