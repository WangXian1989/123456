Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be advantageous for investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for more aggressive investments that have the potential for higher growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts, as they can be more easily accessed without penalties and taxed favorably.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Adjust contributions if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan ahead for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this will affect your tax situation.
   - Strategize the timing of withdrawals from taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts based on projected retirement income.

By systematically following these guidelines, you can create an effective distribution strategy tailored to your unique financial situation.
