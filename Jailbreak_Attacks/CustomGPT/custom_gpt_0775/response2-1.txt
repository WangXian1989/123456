When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, as they offer tax benefits. Aim to maximize contributions to your IRA (both Traditional and Roth options) and your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA reduce your taxable income, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth accounts involve after-tax contributions, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusting as you age or as your risk tolerance changes.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds in Taxable Accounts**: If you have funds in taxable accounts, consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Have a withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your situation, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions and investments among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and enhance your retirement savings.
