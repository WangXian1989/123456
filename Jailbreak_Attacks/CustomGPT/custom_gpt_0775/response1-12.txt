I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. General treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and getting regular exercise. Medications or treatments may also be prescribed based on the underlying cause of the liver issue. Please reach out to a medical expert for accurate guidance.
