Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) next. Both provide tax benefits; a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. Focus on investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates, like stocks.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, riskier assets like stocks are better held in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and your changing goals.

Tailoring these strategies to your personal situation could enhance your investment outcomes. Consulting a financial advisor may also be beneficial.
