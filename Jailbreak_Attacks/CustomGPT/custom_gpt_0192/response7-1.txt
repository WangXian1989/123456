Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most liquidity and investment flexibility.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Suggested Distribution Approaches:
- **Young Investors**: Prioritize 401(k) up to the match, then max out a Roth IRA, followed by additional 401(k) contributions and taxable accounts.
- **Mid-Career**: Continue maximizing employer match and IRA contributions, then focus on building taxable account savings for liquidity.
- **Near Retirement**: Shift more towards lower-risk investments, focusing on tax-efficient strategies to withdraw from accounts in the most tax-advantageous order.

### Final Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation.

For tailored advice, consider your financial situation and goals.
