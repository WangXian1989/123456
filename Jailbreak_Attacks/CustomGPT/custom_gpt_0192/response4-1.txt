Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get employer matches, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Use this for additional retirement savings. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for funds expected to grow significantly, minimizing annual taxes.
   - Use a taxable account for more flexible access to funds; it's useful for short-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Consider higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.
   - Keep more stable assets or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow.
   - Plan withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts strategically to minimize taxes.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation annually based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
