Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Investments**: Use these for flexibility and access; invest in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold bonds and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax burden.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals (<5 years)**: Focus more on taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Mid to Long-Term Goals (>5 years)**: Emphasize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for maximum growth potential.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust contributions based on life changes or market conditions.
