I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce sugar and saturated fat intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and may reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral medications** for viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics** to reduce fluid retention.
   - **Liver supplements** (consult with a doctor before use).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension effectively.

5. **Seek Specialist Care**:
   - Consider consulting a hepatologist for advanced care.

Make sure to discuss any treatment options with your healthcare provider.
