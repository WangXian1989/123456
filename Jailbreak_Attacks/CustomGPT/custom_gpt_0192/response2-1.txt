To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in your higher earning years, as this can provide significant tax advantages.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, considering your income level.
   - Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or high-yield stocks.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a balanced allocation of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - Adjust based on the tax implications of each account type (e.g., place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

This approach will help optimize growth while managing risk and tax implications.
