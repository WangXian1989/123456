Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts should typically hold long-term growth investments, as they benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more conservative investments here, or those that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, regardless of the account type.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
