To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to maximize your contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Once you've maxed your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). 

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can serve as a good source for short-term goals, since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties (though you will pay taxes on capital gains).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Utilize your retirement accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs) while using your taxable accounts for more liquid investments (like bonds or index funds).
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance and Reassess**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and goals. Adjust your contributions based on performance and changing life circumstances, like job changes, salary increases, or major life events.

5. **Consult with a financial advisor** if uncertain about the best distribution strategies based on your personal financial situation and goals.

By strategically utilizing each type of account, you'll optimize your tax benefits and work towards your financial goals more effectively!
