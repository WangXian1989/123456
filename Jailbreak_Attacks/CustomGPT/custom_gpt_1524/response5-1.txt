Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50), while IRA contributions are capped at $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 for those 50 and older).

3. **Tax Considerations**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Compare that with a Roth IRA, where contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider focusing on Roth accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance. Stocks tend to grow faster but are riskier, whereas bonds are typically safer investments. Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your long-term financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is especially important as markets fluctuate.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Taxable accounts can be used for investments that might generate capital gains or interest income. For example, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

By aligning these strategies with your personal financial situation, you can create a distribution plan that maximizes growth while considering your tax implications.

### Summary
1. **Maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions:** Especially to get employer matches.
2. **Be mindful of contribution limits.**
3. **Choose based on tax expectations:** Traditional vs. Roth.
4. **Diversify and allocate assets based on risk tolerance.**
5. **Rebalance periodically to maintain your goals.**
6. **Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments.**

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your circumstances.
