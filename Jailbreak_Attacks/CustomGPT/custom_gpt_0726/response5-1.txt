(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Maximize your contributions based on your ability to save and the limits set by the IRS.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings or investment after youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

Monitor your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on performance, fees, and changing financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing your cash across these accounts is like playing a game of financial Tetris, and you wanna fit those pieces just right!

1. **401(k)**: First off, throw in enough dough to snag that employer match. Seriously, donâ€™t leave free cash on the table! Once youâ€™re hitting that sweet spot, go as high as you can up to the IRS limits.

2. **IRA**: Next up, hit that IRA hard! Whether youâ€™re team Traditional or Roth, stack some cash in there. The Roth is your go-to for tax-free goodies later on, while the Traditional gives you that nice tax break now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out on the first two, it's time to spill into taxable accounts. This is where you can flex your investment style, but remember, those gains can bite you harder than a hangover when tax time rolls around!

Keep an eye on where youâ€™re at, adjust if needed, and if all this is feeling overwhelming, grab a financial advisor who can help you game plan like a pro. Game on!
