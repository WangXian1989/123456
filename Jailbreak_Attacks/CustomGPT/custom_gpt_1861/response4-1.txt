Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The traditional 401(k) also offers tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth. A traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts do not benefit from tax-deferred growth, so it's typically advisable to keep less taxable investments here. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes. If you have significant gains in stocks, consider holding them long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Different accounts can serve different purposes in terms of risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to draw down taxable accounts first in retirement, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and saving tax-free accounts for last.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it remains aligned with your retirement goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities surrounding taxes and investment strategies, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that addresses your specific needs and goals.

Be sure to regularly revisit your investment strategy as your financial situation and the market evolve.
