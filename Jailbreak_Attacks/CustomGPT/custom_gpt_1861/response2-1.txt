The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if youâ€™re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means they reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) (tax-deductible contributions), but also consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you'd like to access before retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and reward. This may involve different assets in tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts based on their tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan to your needs.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-rounded plan that maximizes your investments and prepares you effectively for retirement.
