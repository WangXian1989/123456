I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment options for your liver problem. They will be able to provide guidance based on your specific condition and health history. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, medical procedures, depending on the nature of the liver issue.
