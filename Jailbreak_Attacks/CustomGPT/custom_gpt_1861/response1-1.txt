The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have additional funds after maxing out your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k), particularly if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for money you may need more access to in the short term. These accounts are less restrictive in terms of withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.
