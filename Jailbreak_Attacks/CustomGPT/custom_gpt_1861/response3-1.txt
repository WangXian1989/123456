The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's often wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments for a profit. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**: To manage risk, diversify your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds). Consider how investments in each account complement one another.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or cash-equivalents before heavily investing in your accounts, which will require some liquidity.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are far from retirement, you might prioritize aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA accounts, while keeping your taxable accounts for more liquid assets. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and try to maximize your contributions when possible.

7. **Financial Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals (e.g., retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, children's education).

8. **Tax-efficient Investing**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keeping tax-efficient investments (like indexed funds) in taxable accounts. 

It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation.
