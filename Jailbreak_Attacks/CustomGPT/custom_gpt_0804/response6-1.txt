When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider various factors including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to maximize your distributions:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your overall investment growth.
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first if you need liquidity, as this can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing tax-deferred.
   - **Tax Bracket Management**: Be strategic about your withdrawals to limit your taxable income in retirement, keeping in mind how distributions from your 401(k) and IRA will be taxed.

3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, while maintaining overall balance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocations in response to market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

By taking these steps, you can create a thoughtful and strategic approach to distributing your investments that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
