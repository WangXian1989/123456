The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After you’re getting the employer match, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Taxes**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for flexibility and access to funds. However, interest and dividends in taxable accounts are subject to taxes, while the earnings in tax-advantaged accounts are either tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are well-diversified. This helps manage risk and can lead to more stable returns over time.

5. **Evaluate Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free, which might affect how much you want to keep in each account type.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it’s important to review your allocation regularly and make adjustments as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, talking to a financial professional can help you create a personalized strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.

Balancing tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility based on your individual circumstances is key to effective distribution.
