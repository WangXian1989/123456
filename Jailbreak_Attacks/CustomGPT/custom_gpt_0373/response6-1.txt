To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to maximize employer matching in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Higher Growth Assets in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Keep stocks and high-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts for potential tax benefits.

3. **Contribution Strategy:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally allocate excess funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust allocations based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
