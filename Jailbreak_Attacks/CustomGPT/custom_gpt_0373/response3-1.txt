Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. They offer tax advantages that can help your savings grow.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you have a high-income year where you want to reduce taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still want to invest more, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and liquidity, though you'll pay taxes on earnings.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax impact, while keeping investments with favorable capital gains treatment in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Summary Example Distribution:

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Higher Income Years**: Prioritize 401(k) contributions to reduce taxable income.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional investments as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
