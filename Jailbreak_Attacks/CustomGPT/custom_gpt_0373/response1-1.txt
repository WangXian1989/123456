Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: If you're able, max out your contributions once you get the match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free in retirement) based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on contribution limits; for 2023, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Consider tax-efficient funds or strategies, like holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Recommendations:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes in all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique situation.

Consider these points, and you’ll have a solid foundation for your investment distribution!
