To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match (if available).
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider high-growth investments to benefit from compounding.

2. **IRA**:
   - Choose between Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if age 50+).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, tax-managed funds).
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in accessible savings.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes.
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on performance and life changes.
