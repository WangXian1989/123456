Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer tax-deductible contributions.
   - **401(k):** After getting the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) before turns to taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or investments that may benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Consider holding bonds or other assets that generate ordinary income, which are taxed higher.
   - **Roth IRA:** This is ideal for high-growth investments since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs that generate lower yearly distributions.

### 5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Make regular contributions to all accounts, adjusting as your financial situation changes.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Individual circumstances can vary greatly, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This approach balances the benefits of immediate tax advantages with growth potential, aligning with your long-term financial goals.
