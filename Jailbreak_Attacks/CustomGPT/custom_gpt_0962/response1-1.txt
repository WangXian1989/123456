Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Consider your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: You can contribute more to a 401(k) than to IRAs, so maximize this if possible.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Best if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits. Maximize your IRA contributions after securing employer match in your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more access to your money and potential tax advantages on long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments long-term can minimize tax impact.
   - **Diverse Investments**: Use these accounts for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, like certain bonds or real estate.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally fund a taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing assets.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually and adjust as your goals or market conditions change.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances and objectives. They can help create a comprehensive plan tailored to your specific financial situation.
