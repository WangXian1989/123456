To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account. Often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that donâ€™t have tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Define short-term (buying a house, travel) and long-term (retirement) goals.
   - Assess your risk tolerance. 

3. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Tax Advantage**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth), as they provide significant tax advantages.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

6. **Tax Implications**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds).

7. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set a consistent contribution schedule to all accounts to build wealth over time.

8. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50) to a Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings or money not needed for immediate expenses, potentially focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This distribution strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and the ability to meet both short-term and long-term financial goals.
