Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your tax situation, time horizon, and financial goals. Here’s a general strategy that you might find helpful:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **First Step:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a smart way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider IRA for Additional Tax Advantages**
   - **Next Step:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Third Step:** Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Spread your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Generally, it’s beneficial to have a mix with higher growth potential in your 401(k) and IRA, where taxes are deferred or absent.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and higher-taxed investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Ongoing Strategy:** Periodically reassess your allocation among these accounts to ensure that your strategy aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Before Investing:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Summary
It's often beneficial to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, then move on to taxable accounts, while keeping an eye on asset allocation and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
