Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax-deductible contributions, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across the accounts with an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of where you place certain investments. For example, keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments, like municipal bonds, in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
