When determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Funds grow tax-deferred; you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Good for high-income earners anticipating a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, but offer flexibility for withdrawal. They can be useful for emergency funds or short-term goals.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, equities can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, whereas bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to their interest taxation.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance over time by rebalancing as needed.

5. **Consider Your Goals**: Align your contributions based on your short-term and long-term financial goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your individual situation.
