When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund First**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations). IRAs often provide more investment flexibility than 401(k) plans.

4. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After taking advantage of the IRA, returning to your 401(k) to maximize contributions up to the annual limit is beneficial, especially if the plan has good investment options and low fees.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals and provide more liquidity without penalties for withdrawal.

6. **Investment Choices**: 
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider holding higher-growth assets that may generate taxable events, as these accounts defer taxes.
   - In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changing goals. 

8. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about your current and expected future tax rates. Taxable accounts offer flexibility but can have immediate tax consequences on gains, while tax-advantaged accounts benefit from deferred or tax-free growth.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have complex situations or need personalized advice, consulting a financial advisor can be invaluable.

Balancing these accounts effectively may differ based on individual circumstances, so consider these factors carefully.
