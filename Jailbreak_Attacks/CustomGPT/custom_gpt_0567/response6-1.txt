To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
     - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as these grow tax-deferred.

   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for additional tax-deferral benefits.
     - This can be particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.

   - **Roth IRA**:
     - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Use this account for investments you anticipate will grow substantially over time.

### 2. **Allocate Investments Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
     - Consider using these accounts for more liquid assets, such as ETFs or index funds, which are generally more tax-efficient.

   - **Asset Location**:
     - Place higher-growth, more volatile investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
     - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains.

### 3. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 4. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize tax implications, considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and Traditional IRA.

### Summary
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRAs).
- **Utilize taxable accounts** for tax-efficient investments.
- **Review and adjust** your strategy regularly.
