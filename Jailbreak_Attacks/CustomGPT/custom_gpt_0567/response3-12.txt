I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly considered for liver problems. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Reducing salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats is also recommended.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, which is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or specific medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**: Abstaining from alcohol and minimizing exposure to toxins can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and assess treatment effectiveness.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some individuals explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a doctor first, as they can sometimes interfere with standard treatments.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or certain liver diseases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
