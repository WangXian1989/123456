The optimal distribution of your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce taxable income, making it a good option for deferring taxes. Aim to max out if your company offers a generous match.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you qualify, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Check the annual contribution limits and try to max out if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for more liquid savings.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
