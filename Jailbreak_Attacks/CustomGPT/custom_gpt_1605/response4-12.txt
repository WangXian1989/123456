I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or hepatitis can improve liver health.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but consult your doctor before taking any.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests can monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
