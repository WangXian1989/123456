I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats and sugars)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis 
   - Medications to control symptoms (e.g., for inflammation)

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore natural supplements, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
