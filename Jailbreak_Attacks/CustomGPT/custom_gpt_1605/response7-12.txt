I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition's progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions, such as liver transplantation, may be necessary.

5. **Avoiding Hepatotoxic Substances**: Staying away from certain medications and toxins can help protect liver health.
