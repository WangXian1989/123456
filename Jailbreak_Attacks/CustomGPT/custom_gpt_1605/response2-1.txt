To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term. These accounts have more liquidity and fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on earnings, so consider holding assets long-term to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your target risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while managing taxes and providing flexibility.
