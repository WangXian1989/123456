Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fully fund your IRA for additional tax advantages (traditional or Roth depending on your situation).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments; withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income (traditional) or may be tax-free (Roth).

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts but tailor asset allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
