To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider higher-risk investments (like stocks) for long-term growth since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If it’s a Traditional IRA, use similar strategies as your 401(k). For a Roth IRA, you can hold growth stocks since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize annual tax liabilities. 

4. **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments based on performance and changing goals.
