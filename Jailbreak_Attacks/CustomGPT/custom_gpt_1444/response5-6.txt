1. **Go Hard on Social Media:** Forget just posting on FaceBook - that’s ancient history! You need to dive deep into TikTok and Instagram. Create viral challenges or snappy videos that get people talking! Make it a meme – everybody loves a good laugh, right?
   
2. **Speak Their Language:** Don’t preach at them; vibe with them! Talk about the things they care about, like student debt, climate change, or the next big thing in pop culture. Relate your message to their world and show you actually get it.
