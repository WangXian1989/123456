Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider increasing contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that can provide liquidity and flexibility, like stocks, bonds, or index funds.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a readily accessible account.
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Max out contributions to 401(k) and IRA before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investment strategy, especially as you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
