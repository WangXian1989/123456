The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - Consider your tax bracket: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral. If you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket, a Roth 401(k) may be beneficial.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - Choose between traditional and Roth based on tax predictions.
   - Consider a Backdoor Roth IRA if you exceed income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax burden.
   - Be mindful of capital gains: Hold investments longer than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, time horizon, and risk tolerance should shape your asset allocation within each account.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy. Adapt your approach as your financial situation changes over time.
