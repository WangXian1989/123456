Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit for either a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred; contributions might be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to employer-chosen funds. Diversify within those options.
   - **IRA**: Greater flexibility in choices; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you plan to access before retirement age or for long-term growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan which accounts to draw from first during retirement. Generally, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.

Always consider consulting a financial planner to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
