To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Maximize your employer's match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors typically lean towards more stocks for growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you need immediate tax relief, a traditional IRA might be more suitable as contributions can lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses.

4. **Overall Allocation**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. You can centralize risk management by avoiding concentration of assets in one account type.
   - Adjust the asset allocation based on your time horizon for each account. For instance, you might have more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA compared to a taxable account if you plan to use that money sooner.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
