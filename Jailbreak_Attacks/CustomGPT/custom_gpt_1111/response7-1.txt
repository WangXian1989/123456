To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. It's ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement. Invest here for flexibility, as capital gains are taxed favorably compared to ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account monthly, prioritizing the accounts with tax benefits.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation and performance regularly, making adjustments as needed.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider the tax implications of your withdrawals. Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and leave Roth IRAs for last to maximize tax-free growth.

By balancing contributions based on tax implications, immediate needs, and retirement goals, you can create a well-rounded financial strategy.
