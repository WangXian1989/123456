Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're aiming for higher contributions, this can be a good choice, especially if you benefit from tax deferrals. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, which is $22,500 for 2023 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50 for 2023). If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for mid-term goals and generally come with fewer restrictions than retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate. Understanding how each account type affects your tax situation can inform your distribution strategy.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts before heavily investing in long-term options.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial planner or tax professional to tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances and to ensure you're making informed decisions based on your goals and risk tolerance. Would you like further details on any of these points?
