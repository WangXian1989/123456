Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to optimizing your distributions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. The contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial. Consider your investment options within the 401(k) and how they align with your risk tolerance and timeline.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but taxable withdrawals in retirement, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two depends on whether you expect your tax rate to increase or decrease in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be a good space for holdings that you might need access to before retirement (like emergency funds or short-term goals). Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor recommendations to your specific financial situation and goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

ðŸ’¡ **Avoiding taxes is wise, but the best investment strategy is one that aligns with your overall financial plan and risk tolerance.**
