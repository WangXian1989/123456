Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. 

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once your IRA is funded, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - If you have extra funds after maximizing retirement accounts, invest in a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA** contributions may reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA** offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** may be subject to capital gains tax, but they're more flexible for withdrawals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (enough to maximize match)
- **Roth/Traditional IRA**: $6,500 annually
- **Additional 401(k)**: Increase contributions to reach the max of $22,500
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings or bonuses here.

### Conclusion
Adapting the allocations based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline is crucial. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
