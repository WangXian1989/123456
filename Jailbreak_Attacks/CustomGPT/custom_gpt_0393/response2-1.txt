To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions (Traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation) to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 2. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold assets that produce capital gains or have lower tax rates (e.g., index funds, ETFs). This minimizes tax impact when sold.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on higher-growth assets (stocks) since gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For short-term goals, prioritize safer, more liquid options in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals, take on more risk in your retirement accounts where growth can compound.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds, as the order can affect your tax burden in retirement.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 20%
- **IRA:** 20%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 60% (with focus on low-turnover investments)

### Summary
Balancing contributions and investments based on tax implications and investment goals will help you optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
