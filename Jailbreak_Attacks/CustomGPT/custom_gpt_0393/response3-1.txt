Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your **IRA** (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once you've maximized your IRA, go back to maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once you've maximized your tax-advantaged options.

### Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account.
- **Investment Growth**: Consider growth potential and investment options available in each account.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts may offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the maximum limit
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out the above options

### Regular Rebalancing
- Review and adjust your investments regularly based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
This approach helps balance growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
