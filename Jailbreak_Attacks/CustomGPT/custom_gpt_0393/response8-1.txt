To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - Max out annual contribution limits where possible:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as:
     - **Index funds or ETFs**: Lower capital gains.
     - **Tax-efficient funds**: Designed for taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-term goals**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term goals**: Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, leverage employer matches, and maintain flexibility with taxable accounts. Regularly reassess your strategy as financial needs and goals evolve.
