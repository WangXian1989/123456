Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Tax Advantages**: 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Max Out Limits**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,500 for under 50; $7,500 for 50+ in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Take advantage of capital losses to offset gains and reduce your tax burden.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) first, then consider taxable accounts.
- Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- Rebalance as needed to avoid overexposure to any asset class.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique circumstances.

This approach balances tax efficiency and liquidity, helping you achieve your financial goals over time.
