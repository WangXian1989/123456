Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. IRAs offer tax advantages for retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals outside of retirement or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments here to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Breakdown:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (to get the match)
- **IRA**: Max out (currently $6,500 per year if under 50)
- **Taxable account**: Remainder of your savings after maxing other accounts

### Key Points:
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates.

### Periodic Review:
Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
