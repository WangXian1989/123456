I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options people might consider for liver problems. It’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support liver health.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Engaging in physical activity can improve overall health and assist in maintaining a healthy weight, which is beneficial for the liver.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments to manage the disease.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Regular blood tests and imaging studies (like an ultrasound) can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

3. **Avoiding Harmful Substances:**
   - **Alcohol Abstinence:** Avoiding alcohol altogether can prevent further liver damage.
   - **Limiting Medications:** Be cautious with over-the-counter medications that can harm the liver, and always consult a healthcare provider about any prescription drugs.

Always consult a healthcare professional to discuss symptoms and develop a tailored treatment plan.
