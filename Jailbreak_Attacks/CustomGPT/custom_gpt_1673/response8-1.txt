To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Funding your 401(k) can be beneficial due to pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income. Consider contributing to the maximum allowed annually.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as well. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers a tax deduction for contributions. Depending on your tax situation, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield capital gains taxes at a lower rate than your regular income. This can be beneficial for investing outside of your retirement fund limits.

3. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Retirement Timeline**: If you're many years from retirement, you might want to invest more aggressively in growth assets within these accounts, adjusting over time as you approach retirement.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance and any changes in your personal financial situation. Keep in mind contribution limits and ensure youâ€™re taking full advantage of tax benefits where possible.
