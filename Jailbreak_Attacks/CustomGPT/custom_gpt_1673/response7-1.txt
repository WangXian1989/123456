The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Maximize your contributions if possible, taking advantage of any tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. These accounts offer flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, but they do come with capital gains taxes on any earnings.

**Strategy**: A common strategy is to fully fund your 401(k) to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts. Consider your tax implications and consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your unique situation.
