When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider contributing to this first up to any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may offer tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals, but you'll pay capital gains tax on earnings. Use these for investments that might generate less frequent taxable income.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals and time horizon. Longer-term accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) are well-suited for growth-oriented investments, while taxable accounts might be better for more liquid assets.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of assets across accounts to spread risk. Different accounts may have different tax implications for withdrawals.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Always keep in mind your overall financial picture, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when making decisions.
