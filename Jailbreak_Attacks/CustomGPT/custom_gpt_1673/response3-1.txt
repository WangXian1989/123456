Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current age, income level, tax situation, and overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Free Money**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or not (Roth), but withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. While your primary focus might be on tax-advantaged accounts, ensure your investments are spread across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are far from retirement, you might lean towards aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA. If retirement is near, consider shifting to more conservative options to protect your capital.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to first withdraw from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given your individual circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By considering these points, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
