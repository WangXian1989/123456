Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA:** Maximize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for after-tax savings and investments. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio in each account type, adjusting the asset mix based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before overly investing. Typically, this should cover 3-6 months of expenses in liquid savings.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align each account with your specific financial goals: retirement, buying a home, or other investments.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and contributions based on life changes or market conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
