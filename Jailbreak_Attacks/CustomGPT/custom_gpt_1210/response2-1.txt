Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximum contributions if your cash flow allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional if you want tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider your projected tax rate at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate high capital gains or income, as they are taxed differently. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Consider risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and goals. Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across accounts to maintain your desired asset mix.

### 5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 6. **Specific Goals Planning**
   - Tailor contributions based on your specific financial goals. For example, if you're saving for a house, a taxable account might be more suitable for short-term needs.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, it's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your unique circumstances.
