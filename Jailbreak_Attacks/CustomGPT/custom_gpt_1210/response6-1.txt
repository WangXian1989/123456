Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Workplace Benefits**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money.
   - **Limit**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, especially if you’re in a high-income bracket.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible; however, withdrawals are taxed as income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Growth vs. Income**: Allocate more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for better long-term growth and place more stable (like bonds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances, including retirement age, risk tolerance, and income needs.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective investment strategy that maximizes your growth potential while minimizing your tax liabilities.
