The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider this for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are less tax-advantaged but offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

### 3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Once you max out your employer match in the 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (both Traditional and Roth if eligible).
   - After contributing to your IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k) or taxable accounts, depending on your liquidity needs and tax situation.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep in mind tax efficiency: consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
