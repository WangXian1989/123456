The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Traditional accounts may allow you to lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time horizon until retirement, you might focus more on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA while using taxable accounts for shorter-term goals.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider safer investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different accounts to manage risk effectively. You can hold stocks in your 401(k) and bonds in your IRA, for example.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Different accounts may be subject to different tax implications during retirement. 

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
