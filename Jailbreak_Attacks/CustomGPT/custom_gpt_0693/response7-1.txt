Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible, allowing for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### Factors to Consider

- **Time Horizon**: If you're saving for retirement in the long term, lean more on tax-advantaged accounts. If you need liquidity or are saving for a shorter-term goal, taxable accounts may be better.

- **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Investments in a 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred, while withdrawals from these accounts may be taxed as ordinary income.

- **Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options and fees in your 401(k). If they are limited or costly, you might want to prioritize IRAs or taxable accounts for broader investment choices.

- **Financial Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals. If buying a home, for instance, consider more into taxable accounts, as retirement accounts often have withdrawal penalties.

In summary, a balanced approach often works best: contribute enough to your 401(k) to get employer matching, max out your IRA, and then allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. Regularly reassess and adjust your strategy based on changing circumstances.
