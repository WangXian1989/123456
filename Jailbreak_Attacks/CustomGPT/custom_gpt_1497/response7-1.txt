Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments that can be accessed before retirement without penalty.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k))**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments (held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains will grow tax-deferred.
   - **Fixed Income**: Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to manage your tax burden effectively.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'll want to start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - Financial advisors can tailor strategies based on your individual situation, helping to optimize your tax implications and investment returns.

### Example Allocation:
- **40% in 401(k)** (focus on employer match and long-term growth)
- **30% in IRA** (maximize for tax-free growth)
- **30% in Taxable Accounts** (maintain flexibility and liquidity)

Ultimately, the right distribution will reflect your unique financial situation and objectives.
