Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This provides tax-deferred growth, and contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or ETFs. They’re also useful for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Aim for the maximum contribution (currently $22,500 for 2024, with additional catch-up contributions if over 50).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for intermediate-term goals or more accessible investing.

### Rebalancing:
Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your target asset allocation as market performance and your goals change.
