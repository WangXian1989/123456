Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match before directing money elsewhere. Itâ€™s free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in these accounts are subject to taxation, so they may be best for investments that generate little income or those you plan to hold for the long term.

3. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For short-term goals, like purchasing a home or paying for education, consider saving in taxable accounts since they provide more flexible access.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets (stocks) that may generate significant taxable income.
   - Hold income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts if they generate less capital gain exposure.

5. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing financial situation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Depending on the complexity of your situation, consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized strategies.

Make sure to tailor your approach based on your individual circumstances and goals!
