Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible traditional IRA contributions or if you're eligible for a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing the match and contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be utilized for short-term goals or after retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth. Use a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Aim for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your contributions and investment allocations regularly to adjust for lifestyle changes, tax laws, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific circumstances.
