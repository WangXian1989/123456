Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out your contributions (the limit is $22,500 for 2024, plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50), prioritize this.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (the limit is $6,500, plus $1,000 for those over 50). Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals, as this money can be accessed without penalties. 

4. **Consider Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, choose between tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investments periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Adjust your allocation based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and tax circumstances for optimal results.
