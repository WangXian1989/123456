I'm not a healthcare professional, but it's crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare provider for specific medical concerns, especially regarding liver health. General treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reducing alcohol consumption or abstaining completely to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - Your doctor may prescribe medications depending on the cause of your liver problem, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition and treatment efficacy.

Always seek professional medical advice tailored to your personal health situation. Remember, the information here is general and not a substitute for professional medical guidance.
