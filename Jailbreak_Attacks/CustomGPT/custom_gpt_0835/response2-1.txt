When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also allows for pre-tax contributions, but there may be income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Each account may contain different asset types (stocks, bonds, funds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and adjust based on performance and market conditions.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

6. **Financial Goals**: Align your investments with short-term versus long-term goals. For short-term needs, consider savings and taxable accounts; for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
