I'm not a healthcare professional, but it's important to consult with a doctor regarding liver problems. They can provide personalized treatment options based on your specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, more advanced interventions like surgery. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for any medical concerns.
