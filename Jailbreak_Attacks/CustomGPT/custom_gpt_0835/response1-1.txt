I'm here primarily for cannabis-related education, but I'd recommend consulting a financial advisor for personalized investment strategies. They can help you determine the best allocation based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Each account type has its benefits, so professional guidance would be beneficial for your situation! ðŸŒ¿
