Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to optimize your investments:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Contributing to the max is beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Prioritize Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, tax situation, and retirement timeline, decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible now) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - **Annual Limit**: The 2024 contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds for short-term goals or emergency savings here. 
   - **Invest Tax-Efficiently**: Select investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Recommendations:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts for risk management.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of when you might be withdrawing funds and the tax implications, especially with retirement accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed, keeping your risk tolerance and retirement timeline in mind.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
