For liver problems, treatment options can vary based on the specific condition (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced, low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the underlying condition, medications may be prescribed. For example:
     - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
     - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but always consult a healthcare professional before trying these.

It's crucial to work closely with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific situation.
