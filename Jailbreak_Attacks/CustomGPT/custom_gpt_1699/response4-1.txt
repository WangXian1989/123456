The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Finish Funding the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, direct additional funds to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement, as they allow easy access. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts, especially in retirement. 

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
