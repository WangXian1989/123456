To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It offers tax-deferred growth and may have higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax considerations.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals.

3. **Expense Ratios**:
   - Look for low-cost investment options within your 401(k) and IRA to minimize fees.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) proportional to your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before maximizing retirement account contributions.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on market performance and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments and minimize tax liabilities.
