I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver health treatment options. The best course of action usually depends on the specific liver condition, but here are common approaches:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Avoiding alcohol is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions, like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding toxins can help improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver health.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, though it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider first, as some can be harmful to the liver.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases or for conditions like tumors, surgical options may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
