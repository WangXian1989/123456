Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors: tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions for tax-free growth (or tax-deferred for traditional IRAs).

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use for growth investments, potentially more aggressive options if retirement is far off.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is many years away, lean more heavily into retirement accounts.
   - Closer to retirement? Shift towards preserving capital, possibly moving funds into safer investments like bonds.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your distribution and re-balance as needed based on performance and life changes.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
- Adjust based on your financial goals and timeline.
