Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (for Roth 401(k)), affecting your immediate tax burden.

### 2. **IRA:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, make the maximum contributions annually.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **For Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and allow you to access funds without penalty.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before heavily investing.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fund your 401(k) and IRA fully before contributing large amounts to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
  - **Younger Investors**: May lean towards growth investments (stocks).
  - **Closer to Retirement**: More conservative (bonds, stable investments).

### **Periodic Review:**
- Regularly assess your asset allocation and re-balance as necessary based on life changes or market conditions.

### **Consider Professional Advice:**
- Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
