Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for effective financial planning. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Advantaged Accounts)**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts first, as they provide tax deferral (or tax-free growth in the case of Roth accounts).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets here, such as index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that generate minimal taxable income.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (e.g., saving for a house) and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter gains from taxes until retirement.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA before adding more to the 401(k) if you're eligible for deductible contributions.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified allocation within each account, but avoid overlap to maximize growth potential.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your target asset allocation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match and consider aggressive investment options.
- **IRA**: Choose between a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
- **Taxable**: Use this account for investments needing flexibility, like emergencies or short-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions between these accounts while considering tax efficiency, risk, and investment goals can help optimize your overall investment strategy.
