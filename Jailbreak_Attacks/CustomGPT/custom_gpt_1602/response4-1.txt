Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax benefits, investment objectives, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement contributions. These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market changes, investment performance, and financial goals.
