When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Once you’re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Invest more in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) early in your career when you may be in a lower tax bracket. This helps reduce taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility for early access to money, but keep in mind potential capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive, higher-growth assets in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping more stable investments in your taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, changing market conditions, and tax laws.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
