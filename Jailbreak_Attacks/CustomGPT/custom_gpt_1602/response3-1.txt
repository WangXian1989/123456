Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to this if you have not reached the maximum contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, plus an extra $7,500 if you're over 50). It reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement and for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Generally, keep growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize the tax impact of their earnings.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in your investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary greatly, so consider getting professional advice tailored to your circumstances.

This strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and flexibility, helping you achieve your financial goals.
