To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for each account type along with pros and cons:

### 1. 401(k):
   - **Advantages**:
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money."
     - Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), reducing your taxable income.
     - Investment growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Limited investment options compared to IRAs.
     - Penalties for early withdrawals (before age 59½).

### 2. IRA (Traditional and Roth):
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, tax-deferred growth.
     - **Disadvantages**: Taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during your lifetime.
     - **Disadvantages**: Income limits for contributions can restrict eligibility.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits, and opportunity to invest in a wider range of assets.
   - **Disadvantages**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, as well as income taxes on dividends and interest.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain the full employer match.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA can be ideal for younger investors who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
3. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diverse across different asset classes within each account type.
5. **Regularly Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Summary:
Your specific situation (age, income, retirement goals) will heavily influence the best distribution strategy. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan that considers your unique circumstances. Happy investing!
