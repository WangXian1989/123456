(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your age, investment goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), start there. Contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money".

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred. If you have a Roth IRA available, it can also be beneficial to contribute there for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications for Taxable Accounts:** If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and have additional funds to invest, you can then turn to taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and choose your investments accordingly (e.g., favoring tax-efficient investments).

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your investment strategy is diversified to mitigate risks.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly:** Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on your financial situation and changing goals.

1. **Employer Match is Key:** First off, get the most bang for your buck by snatching that employer match in your 401(k). Not grabbing that is like leaving free shots on the table â€“ just not smart!

2. **Tax Shelters are Your Friends:** Next up, hit those tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA hard. You want to let that money grow without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck every year. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free shenanigans later in life!

3. **Take It Easy on Taxes in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out the good stuff, head over to taxable accounts. But keep your eyes peeled for capital gains taxes â€“ nobody wants those pesky surprises come tax season.

4. **Diversify Like a Pro:** Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Spread your investments around across those accounts to lower your risk. You wouldnâ€™t want a single bad decision to wreck your plans, right?

5. **Regularly Check Your Game Plan:** Finally, donâ€™t just set it and forget it â€“ keep your allocations in check and make sure they still line up with your financial dreams. 

In short, it's all about that strategic mix while keeping an eye on tax efficiency, so you can enjoy your future, not fret about it! Happy investing!
