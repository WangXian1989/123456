To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your income and tax rate to be higher in retirement, lean towards a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you need a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA might be preferable.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits for both types of IRAs, as they can differ based on your age.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or a low-risk investment in your taxable account.
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access within a few years, keeping in mind that long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with long-term growth potential (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Annually reassess your contribution strategy and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Happy investing!
