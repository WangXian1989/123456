It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Typically come with employer matching which is essentially "free money." Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment options compared to IRAs and possibly higher fees.
   - **Strategy**: Max out any employer match before directing funds elsewhere. 

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can provide immediate tax benefits.
     - **Cons**: Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - **Cons**: Income limits for contributions.
   - **Strategy**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. Otherwise, a mix can be beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits.
   - **Cons**: Capital gains tax on earnings can reduce your overall return.
   - **Strategy**: Use for short-term goals or after you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals.

### General Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) and Employer Match**: Aim for at least the maximum contribution your employer matches.
2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, fund your Roth IRA up to the maximum contribution.
3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds, consider contributing here, especially if you're seeking tax deductions.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need sooner (or for investing in things that may not belong in tax-advantaged accounts, like certain ETFs or real estate).

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a solid emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Make sure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
- **Long-term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.).

### Final Tip:
It might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, as they can provide personalized advice.

Happy investing!
