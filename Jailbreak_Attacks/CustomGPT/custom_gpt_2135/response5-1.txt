Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or for funds you might need before retirement. Consider low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Consider Investment Allocation**:
   - Allocate a diversified portfolio across all accounts, focusing on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Key Tips:
- Stay informed about contribution limits and tax implications.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Always prioritize your financial goals and retirement timeline when making these decisions.
