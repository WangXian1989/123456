I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
   - **Exercise**: Aim for regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help control infections.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases, these can reduce inflammation.

3. **Supplements**:
   - **Milk Thistle**: Often used as a natural remedy for liver health, though consult your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect issues early.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
