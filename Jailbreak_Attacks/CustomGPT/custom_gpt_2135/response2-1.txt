Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a basic guide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred, often with employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; options include traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxable. Useful for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding a taxable account for additional savings or investment opportunities.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Based on risk tolerance, allocate different percentages to stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-efficient Investing**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Consider selling losing investments in taxable accounts to offset gains for tax purposes.

### 5. **Future Needs**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you’ll access funds. Consider required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts in the future.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid funds available outside of retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances by discussing with a financial professional, especially for complex situations.

Using this balanced approach will help optimize your savings and investments for both short-term needs and long-term retirement goals.
