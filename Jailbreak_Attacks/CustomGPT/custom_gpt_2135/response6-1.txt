When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that are more accessible.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Risk**
   - Reassess your asset allocation across all accounts, ensuring a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Heavy gains should stay in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Bonds, which generate interest income, may be better in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
