Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions (up to $6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50), continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit ($22,500 or $30,000 if over 50).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged treatment, such as short-term trading or certain types of ETFs that generate capital gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes in all accounts.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement timelines.
