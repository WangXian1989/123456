Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.
   
### 3. **Max Out Contributions**
   - If you have the capacity, aim to max out contributions in both your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (under 50), $30,000 (50+)
     - IRA: $6,500 (under 50), $7,500 (50+)

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - For immediate tax benefits, prioritize Traditional accounts.

### 5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - After maxing out tax-deferred accounts, use taxable accounts for short-term goals and investments. This allows for greater flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 6. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Always keep an emergency fund separate from these investments to cover unexpected expenses.

### 7. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts by risk tolerance and time horizon, considering stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 8. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to keep your investments aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
This strategy helps balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Tailor your contributions based on your specific financial situation, goals, and timeframes. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
