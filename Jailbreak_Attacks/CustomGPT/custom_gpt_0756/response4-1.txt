To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. You will pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth with taxes owed on withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (plus an additional $7,500 for those over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you are over 50).

3. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investment distribution with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each account.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to spread risk.

5. **Employer Matches:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as it is essentially free money.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your anticipated withdrawal strategy in retirementâ€”how and when you'll access funds from each account can influence your distribution.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out the employer match in your 401(k) first.**
- **Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and eligibility.**
- **Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment opportunities that may offer more liquidity or specific investment strategies.**

### Ongoing Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your contribution strategy based on performance, changing financial goals, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation. 

It's important to understand that the ideal distribution of funds will vary based on individual circumstances and evolving financial landscapes.
