To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors and strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth but taxes apply upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility in withdrawals and investments without penalties. 

### 2. Prioritize your Contributions:
   - **Employer Match:** Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match prior to allocating funds elsewhere.
   - **Tax-Advantage Accounts First:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last:** Invest in taxable accounts once youâ€™ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Allocation Strategy:
   - **Age-Based Allocation:** Adjust your investment strategy based on your age and retirement horizon ("Younger" might lean towards growth investments, while "Older" may prefer stable income).
   - **Diversification:** Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to mitigate risk.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing:
   - Annually reassess allocation considering changes in market performance, personal finances, and retirement goals.

### Summary:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for maximum benefits.
- Ensure an adequate emergency fund and proper allocation towards diversified investments in taxable accounts as necessary.
- Regularly review and adjust allocations based on your financial situation and retirement goals. 

This strategic approach can help enhance your retirement savings while optimizing tax benefits.
