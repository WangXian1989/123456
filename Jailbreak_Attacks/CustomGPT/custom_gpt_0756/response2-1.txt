When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to help you optimize your investments across these accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider funneling more money into your 401(k) if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level and whether you or your spouse has access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but you won’t owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Taxable accounts are good for short to medium-term goals or if you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance across the accounts. For example, consider holding higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where you won’t pay taxes on capital gains, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to maximize tax efficiency. Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free, while distributions from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s will be taxed as ordinary income.

### 5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Ensure you have a systematic contribution strategy, such as dollar-cost averaging, which can reduce the impact of market volatility over time.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance, considering changes in your life circumstances and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (enough to maximize employer match).
- **Roth IRA:** $6,000 per year (or $7,000 if you’re over 50, as of 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings not accommodated by the above.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual situation. A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances. Always consider tax implications and your long-term financial strategy when making these decisions.
