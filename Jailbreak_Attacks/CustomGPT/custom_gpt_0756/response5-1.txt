(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. In general, it's beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k). This ensures that you maximize your retirement savings potential. 

Once youâ€™ve taken full advantage of these accounts, you can then consider your taxable accounts. A common strategy is to hold tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts since they generate fewer taxable events compared to actively managed funds. Additionally, consider your liquidity needs and if you may need to access some funds sooner than others, as this can affect your distribution strategy.

The first rule: get as much dough as you can into those tax-advantaged accounts because Uncle Sam is waiting to take a cut when you cash out! First off, max out the employer match on your 401(k). Thatâ€™s free moneyâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table! After youâ€™ve snatched that, dive into your IRA, traditional or Roth depending on whether you want to slice taxes now or later. 

Now, once youâ€™re stuffed to the brim with retirement magic, sprinkle some money into taxable accounts. This is where you can get a bit spicy with your investments. Make sure you invest in tax-efficient stuff like index funds or ETFs, which wonâ€™t leave you crying at tax time. Just keep an eye on your liquidity needs; you donâ€™t want to be stuck digging for quarters just because you put all your chips on retirement! Balance is key, like a financial tightrope walker!
