It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice for your liver problem. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or liver cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, and in severe cases, procedures like surgery or liver transplantation. Always seek medical guidance for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
