To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. 

2. **Balance Growth and Accessibility**:
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) that generate interest, as you'll be taxed on these each year anyway.

3. **Adjust Based on Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize traditional retirement accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for the upfront tax deduction.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket or expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals to minimize taxes: withdrawing from taxable accounts first can preserve tax-advantaged accounts for longer.

By weighing these considerations, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Always reassess your distribution as your financial situation or tax laws change.
