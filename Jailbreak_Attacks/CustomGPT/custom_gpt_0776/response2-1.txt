The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, since contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, distribute funds here based on your expected tax situation in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility and access. You can invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. This may be a good place for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts. This fund should typically cover 3 to 6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to balance risk and reward.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and financial goals.
