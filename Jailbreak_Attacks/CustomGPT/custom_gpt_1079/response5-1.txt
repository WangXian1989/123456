(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, income level, and financial goals. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider prioritizing contributions to your IRA, particularly if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Understand the tax implications:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets with lower turnover and qualified dividends in these accounts.

4. **Invest Based on Goals**: Allocate funds based on your investment goals and time horizon. Long-term growth can be focused in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals may be better served by taxable accounts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
