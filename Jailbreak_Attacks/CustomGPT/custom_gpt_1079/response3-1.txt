To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Retirement account with tax advantages; can be either traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax benefits; dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 2. Assess Your Financial Goals
- Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
- Consider when you will need the funds (e.g., retirement, buying a house, education).

### 3. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA after reaching the employer match. Choose between traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after maximizing retirement accounts.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified mix of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. Tax Efficiency
- Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. Adjust Over Time
- Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on performance, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for any available employer match, then to an IRA, and finally allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.
- Diversify investments within each account while considering tax implications based on account type.
