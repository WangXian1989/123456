To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Accounts

- **401(k)**: 
  - Tax-deferred account, often with employer matching contributions.
  - Contributions reduce taxable income.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
  - Traditional IRA: Tax-deferred until withdrawal; may offer tax deductions.
  - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - Funded with after-tax dollars; any gains or income are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."

- **Consider Tax Implications**:
  - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize your traditional IRA or 401(k) for tax deferment.
  - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in the future.

### 3. Weighting Contributions

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a suitable emergency fund before maximizing retirement accounts.

- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing heavily.

- **Allocate Investments**: Once your emergency fund is established, allocate your contributions with an eye on tax efficiency:
  - Place **bonds and high-income investments** in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize current taxes.
  - Keep **stocks** in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust

- Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- As your income changes or tax laws evolve, adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.

### Conclusion

Distributing your investments smartly among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Prioritize employer matches, consider your tax situation, and remember to regularly review your financial strategy.
