To decide the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors including your current financial situation, future goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. Understand the Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax advantages. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth with post-tax contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held in regular brokerage accounts that do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. Prioritization of Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA next, especially if you can take advantage of tax benefits (especially a Roth IRA).
- **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to maxing out your 401(k) if permissible.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexible Needs:** Use taxable accounts for savings or investments that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax Bracket Consideration:** Higher earners might benefit from pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRAs) to reduce taxable income now, whereas lower-income years might make after-tax contributions (Roth IRA) more beneficial.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds. 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not.

### 4. Investment Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Growth-oriented investments might go into retirement accounts, while more liquid or conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Consider asset allocation based on your timeline for withdrawal.

### 5. Regular Reviews
- Monitor the performance and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Regularly rebalancing your portfolio can help align with your strategy.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while considering personal goals and future needs will optimize your financial strategy. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution based on your unique circumstances.
