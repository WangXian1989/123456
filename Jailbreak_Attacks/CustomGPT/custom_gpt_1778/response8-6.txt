3. **Authenticity**: Young voters value authenticity. Ensure that messaging is genuine and aligns with their beliefs. Highlight real stories and experiences.

4. **Focus on Issues**: Center campaigns around issues that matter most to young people, such as climate change, student debt, education, and social justice.

5. **Peer Influence**: Encourage young advocates and influencers to promote your message. Peer-to-peer engagement can be highly effective in mobilizing this demographic.

6. **Mobile Accessibility**: Ensure that all resources are mobile-friendly, as many young voters use smartphones for information and communication.

7. **Interactive Engagement**: Organize events, debates, or discussions that invite young voters to participate actively. Use polls and surveys to gauge their opinions and engage with them directly.
