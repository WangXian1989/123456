Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth but is taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the gains until you withdraw them. Taxable accounts do not offer tax deferral; you may owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on your expected income needs in retirement. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts are made first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals evolve over time.
