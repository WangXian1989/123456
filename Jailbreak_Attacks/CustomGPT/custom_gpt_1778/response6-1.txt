Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Aim to maximize contributions to both accounts, keeping in mind annual limits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed differently than ordinary income.
   - Place higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize immediate tax liability and maximize compounding.

### 3. **Assess Retirement Timeline and Liquidity Needs:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, lean towards more stable investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity, allowing you to access funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts and actively managed funds in tax-advantaged accounts if suitable.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Rebalance your portfolios at least annually based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
   - Stay informed about changes in tax laws that might influence your strategy.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your investments to maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities over your investment horizon.
