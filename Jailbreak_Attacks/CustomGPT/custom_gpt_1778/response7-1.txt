The best approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains in taxable accounts are taxed at capital gains rates. Consider placing investments with high turnover or income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Debt Management**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before investing heavily.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in an emergency fund before maxing out retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline. Long-term investments can withstand market fluctuations.

### Suggested Contribution Order:
1. Contribute to the 401(k) at least to the match.
2. After that, consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify.
3. Then, continue increasing contributions to the 401(k).
4. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity needs.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized advice.
