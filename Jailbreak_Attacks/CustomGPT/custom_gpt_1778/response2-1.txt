The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, prioritize this account. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA as it can offer tax advantages (deductible contributions for Traditional IRAs and tax-free withdrawals for Roth IRAs).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For taxable accounts, you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. It's usually wise to place investments that generate higher yields (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding lower-yield investments (like equities) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund in cash or a highly liquid account. This should be separate from your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Spread your investments across various asset classes in each type of account to reduce risk. This may include stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

6. **Rebalancing Over Time**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and your changing risk tolerance as you approach retirement.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you craft a long-term strategy.

Always reassess your distribution strategy periodically as your financial situation and market conditions change.
