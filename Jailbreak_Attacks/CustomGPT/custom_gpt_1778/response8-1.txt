Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions grow tax-free.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually, if feasible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate more frequent taxes, like stocks (to benefit from long-term capital gains).
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Funds**: Choose investments that minimize annual tax liabilities (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

### 4. **General Guidelines**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep the most tax-efficient investments in your taxable account. Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Strategy**: Monitor tax implications. Use losses in taxable accounts to offset gains when necessary.
   - **Reassess Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to adjust for any life changes or shifts in financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially if you have complex financial situations.

This balanced strategy can help maximize your overall returns while considering both short- and long-term tax implications.
