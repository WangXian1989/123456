Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here’s a breakdown of strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align investments with your goals; for example:
   - Long-term growth (e.g., retirement) might lean towards stocks and mutual funds in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may warrant more liquidity in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Placement**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: As your income, goals, and market conditions change, review and adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.
