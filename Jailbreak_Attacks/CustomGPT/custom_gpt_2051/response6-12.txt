3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular Check-Ups:** Routine liver function tests to monitor the condition.
   - **Imaging Studies:** Ultrasounds or MRIs can assess liver health and detect abnormalities.

4. **Procedures:**

Always follow your doctor's advice tailored to your specific condition.
