Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions, especially to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Diversify Tax Exposure**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that could benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations at least annually to adjust for market changes and your evolving financial goals.

This strategy will help optimize your tax efficiency and growth potential while preparing for retirement.
