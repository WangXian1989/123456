To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matching contribution if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider the tax advantages of a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversity in Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options; consider a diversified mix of index funds and target date funds.
   - **IRA**: More investment choices; include a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps alternative investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Aim for investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Keep in mind that funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, providing liquidity if needed before retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Tax Impact**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a professional who can help structure your investments based on your individual goals and risk tolerance.

Implementing these strategies can help you optimize your investment across all account types for long-term growth.
