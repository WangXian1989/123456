Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, max out contributions to an IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement (consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals).
   - **HSA**: If available, consider a Health Savings Account (HSA) as it offers triple tax advantages.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals and uses favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities better.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and adjust your contributions based on changes to income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
