Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged options, use taxable accounts for investments that may require more liquidity or have different tax treatments, such as municipal bonds or certain ETFs.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your asset allocation based on each account's tax implications. For example, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize interest tax burdens, and keep equities in taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains tax treatment.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds. Generally, taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while 401(k) and IRAs have rules and potential penalties.

### 4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. An advisor can help optimize your approach based on current laws and market conditions.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a diversified and efficient portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
