Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits:** Aim to maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
- **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide which type of IRA aligns with your tax strategy. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexible Access:** Use these for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner without penalties.
- **Investment Choices:** Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or long-term capital gains assets.

### 4. **Considerations for Allocation**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Diversification:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Long-term Strategy**
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

By strategically distributing your money, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax impacts.
