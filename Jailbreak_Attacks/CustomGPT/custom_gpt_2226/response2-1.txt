To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your anticipated future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and can be accessed without penalties, but investments will be subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on holding investments that are expected to generate ordinary income (like bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensuring you're not overly exposed to any one area.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before maximizing contributions, as liquidity is important outside of these retirement vehicles.

Ultimately, individual circumstances vary, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific needs.
