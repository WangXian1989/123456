Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth) as these offer tax advantages. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds or long-term investments) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced mix of assets in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about when you might need access to funds, as early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur taxes and penalties.

6. **Review Regularly**: Check your distribution strategy periodically and adjust based on performance and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always a good idea!
