Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Ideal for higher earners; your contributions reduce taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement—great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for liquidity and investments not tied to retirement; you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Assess Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds, as choices may be limited. Look for low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Greater flexibility; diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 30% of your overall investments.
- **IRA**: 30% with a focus on growth-oriented investments.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40% for more accessible funds and diverse investment opportunities.

By strategically balancing contributions and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and accessibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
