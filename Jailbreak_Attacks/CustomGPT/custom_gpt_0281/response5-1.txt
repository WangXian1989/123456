The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax benefits.

3. **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Use any leftover savings for your 401(k) or taxable accounts. 

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk profile.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
