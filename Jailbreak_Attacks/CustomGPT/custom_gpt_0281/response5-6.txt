1. **Hit 'Em on Social Media**: Think TikTok and Instagram—create catchy, meme-worthy content. Videos, challenges, and influencer collabs can go a long way to capture their attention.

2. **Speak Their Language**: Focus on issues that keep them awake at night: climate change, student debt, and equality. Use real stories and hard-hitting stats to back it up—make it personal!

3. **Get Them Moving**: Throw some events they can’t resist—festivals, concerts, or volunteer days that feel more like a party than a boring meeting.
