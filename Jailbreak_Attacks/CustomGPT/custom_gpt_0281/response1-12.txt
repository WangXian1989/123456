I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
