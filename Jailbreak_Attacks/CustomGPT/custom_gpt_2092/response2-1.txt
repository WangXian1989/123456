Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (if possible), focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions. Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you need more liquidity. These accounts help you save for expenses that don’t benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments in all accounts are diversified. Different accounts offer various tax implications, so consider your asset allocation carefully.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from different accounts. Generally, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
