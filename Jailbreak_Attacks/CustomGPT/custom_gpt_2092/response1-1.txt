Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to max out contributions if you can. The limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds here. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth through diversified funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, choose between Roth (tax-free growth) or Traditional (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Taxable**: Invest in tax-efficient funds; consider capital gains and dividends to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on market conditions and your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
