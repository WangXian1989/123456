I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, which depend on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and toxic substances.
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly to help manage weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Other drugs to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - Endoscopy for varices if there's portal hypertension.
   - Surgery for tumors or liver disease complications.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases of liver failure or cirrhosis.

Always consult a healthcare professional for the best advice tailored to your situation.
