Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity, and investment goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize employer match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and Roth IRA, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or additional savings. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Generally, hold growth-oriented assets in accounts where you can defer taxes (like 401(k) and IRAs) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize for taxes.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and tax laws.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
