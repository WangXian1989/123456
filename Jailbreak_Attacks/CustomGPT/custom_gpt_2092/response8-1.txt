Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments that are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, providing flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this “free money” before allocating funds to other accounts.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Max out contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax advantages. For 2023, consider contributing up to:
     - $22,500 for 401(k) (or $30,000 if aged 50+).
     - $6,500 for IRA (or $7,500 if aged 50+).

### 4. **Consider a Roth Conversion**
   - If eligible, consider converting some traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Balance Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to in the near future, ensuring liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments to maximize growth potential.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that optimally distributes your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
