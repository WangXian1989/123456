To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k)):
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: If you opt for a Traditional IRA, like the 401(k), contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. If you choose a Roth IRA, contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a mix of investments in each account type. Your 401(k) and IRA can contain more tax-advantaged investments (like stocks for growth), while taxable accounts can hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage tax impacts.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts for more liquidity.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts. Adjust contributions and investments as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate cash reserves in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals.
