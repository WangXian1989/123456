To optimize your investment strategy, consider these key points for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matching first, as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the highest match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawal, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**: 
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that are less tax efficient. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk assets (like stocks) may go into accounts with the longest time horizon (like a 401(k) or IRA).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, if applicable.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after market fluctuations.
