(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially "free money." Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking for a tax deduction, a traditional IRA might be better.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings, especially if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

Balancing contributions based on your tax bracket and retirement timeline can also help. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance that fits your circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! First off, take advantage of your 401(k) like it’s Black Friday—max out that employer match! That’s free cash, and who doesn’t love free stuff? Next, slam some cash into an IRA, preferably a Roth if you’re cool with paying taxes now for tax-free dough later. It’s like future-proofing your finances!

Then, let’s talk taxable accounts. Think of them as your “spending money” for cool stuff in the future. Diversify, invest wisely—look at low-capital gains options like index funds. The key? Ditch the stress and tackle your distribution based on your current cash flow, tax brackets, and retirement vibe. And don’t hesitate to snag a financial advisor for some extra brainpower. Let’s make that money work harder than a caffeinated squirrel!
