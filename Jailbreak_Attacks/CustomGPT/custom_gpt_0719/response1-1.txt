The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years and want to reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Depending on whether you opt for a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, this can influence your tax situation now and in retirement.
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals (subject to conditions) in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment strategies that benefit from lower capital gains taxes or for money you'll need before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize the tax burden.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before aggressively investing.
- **40-50% in 401(k)**: If you’re taking full advantage of employer contributions—this could be a substantial portion.
- **30-40% in IRAs**: Take advantage of tax-advantaged growth; split between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- **10-20% in Taxable Accounts**: Use it for more flexible, shorter-term goals and ensure you’re using tax-efficient investment options.

### Review Regularly:
- Continually reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances for optimal results.
