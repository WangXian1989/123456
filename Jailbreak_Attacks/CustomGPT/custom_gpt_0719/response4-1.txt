When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to think about several factors that can influence your investment strategy. Here are some key points to take into account:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, taxes will be owed upon withdrawal in retirement. A Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA involve after-tax contributions, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax benefits. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments, and dividends may also be taxable.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you are investing for retirement and have a long time horizon, prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.
   - For shorter-term goals or emergency funds, you might consider keeping more liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s, IRAs, and Roth IRAs. As of 2023, the contribution limits for 401(k)s are typically higher than those for IRAs.

### 4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, it's generally a good idea to contribute enough to get the full match before funneling money into other accounts, as this is essentially "free money."

### 5. **Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA. Some plans may have excellent investment choices, while others may be limited or have high fees.

### 6. **Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the rules for withdrawals from each type of account. For example, early withdrawals from an IRA can incur penalties, while 401(k) plans may have different regulations.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. 
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After capturing the full match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and retirement tax strategy.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility or short-term goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your total contributions (up to the matching contribution limit)
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions (up to the limit)
- **Taxable Account**: Any excess funds after maximizing above accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, so it might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific needs and goals.
