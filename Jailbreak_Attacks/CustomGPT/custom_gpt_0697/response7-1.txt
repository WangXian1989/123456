To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and may include employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, with Roth IRAs providing tax-free growth for qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but less tax-efficient for investments, as they are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first; this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - After maxing out these options, contribute to a taxable account for liquidity and investment flexibility.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with long-term growth potential (401(k) and Roth IRA).
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability on interest income.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains treatment.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield from immediate taxation.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, contributions, and changing financial goals.
