Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider for effective asset allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, you may want to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. 

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Asset Allocation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds here, since capital gains taxes apply.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Utilize these accounts for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or interest income, like actively managed funds or bonds.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For longer-term investments (e.g., retirement), you can afford to take more risks. Consider a more aggressive allocation in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For medium to short-term savings (e.g., buying a house), maintain a more conservative approach in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk. Hold different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy. This is crucial as markets fluctuate.

### Suggested Ratio Example (for a moderate risk profile)
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Important Considerations
- **Withdrawal Plans:** Consider your strategies for withdrawals during retirement and the impacts of taxes on these withdrawals.
- **Income Levels:** Assess how your current vs. future income could affect your tax situation, influencing where to allocate funds.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized insights based on your unique financial situation.
