To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match in the 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, you should aim to fund tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This can help reduce your current tax burden and offer tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket, maxing out contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income. If you're in a lower bracket, consider a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts over time and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this can affect your tax situation. Taxable accounts may be more beneficial for short-term needs, while tax-advantaged accounts should be left to grow longer.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Lastly, it can be helpful to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor to align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals.

Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so consider your personal financial goals when making these decisions.
