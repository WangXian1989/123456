Deciding how to allocate funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals (after age 59Â½ and after the account has been open for five years) are tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Consider using this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might choose a more aggressive mix (like stocks) in your taxable account and a more conservative mix (like bonds) in your IRAs or 401(k).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. This includes considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs, which start at age 72.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Monitor your accounts and reallocate investments as market conditions change or as you approach retirement age.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial professional can offer personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns your investments with your long-term financial goals while taking into account the tax implications of each account type.
