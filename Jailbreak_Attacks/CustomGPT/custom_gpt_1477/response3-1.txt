Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize 401(k) Contributions
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match as it's essentially free money.
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. Consider an IRA
- **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, this can provide tax deductions, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility**: Offer more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
- **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k)** contributions to at least the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
3. **Invest any remaining funds** into a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Additional Tips
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your portfolio based on performance and market conditions.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
