To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need access to before retirement or for short-term goals. Diversify into investments that may be more tax-efficient, like index funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally:
   - Higher risk (e.g., stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Lower-risk investments (e.g., bonds) can be in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Annually review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of fees in each account. Opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your individual financial situation and goals.

This approach can help optimize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes.
