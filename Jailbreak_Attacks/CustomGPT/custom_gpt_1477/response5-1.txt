(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money, so prioritize that.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. This depends on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. Focus on long-term growth investments, like index funds, to minimize tax impact.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **Max Out that 401(k)**: First off, snag the employer match. Itâ€™s like finding money on the street! Aim to hit the max contribution limit if you canâ€”this will reduce your taxable income.

2. **Roth or Traditional IRA**: Next, hit up your IRA. If you're in a relatively low tax bracket now, the Roth is your buddy for tax-free withdrawals later. If you need the tax break now, go traditional. Just know the rules for income limits.

3. **Tackle Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you're maxed out in the previous two, dive into taxable accounts. These are freedom fundsâ€”invest in index funds or solid long-term plays. Watch out for short-term capital gains though; theyâ€™ll hit your wallet hard!

Remember to tweak as your life changesâ€”consulting a pro is never a bad call!
