Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows (2024 limit: $23,000).
   - **IRA:**
     - Fund a traditional or Roth IRA (2024 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+).
     - Choose a Roth for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs).
     - Hold more stable investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts on capital gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Utilize these for expenses in the near term or to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates (lower than ordinary income rates).

### 3. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments based on performance and changes in goals.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement; prioritize accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

By carefully considering these elements, you can create a balanced and efficient strategy for your financial future.
