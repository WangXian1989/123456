When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some effective strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Fill Up Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before placing money in taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes. Use lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where dividends and interest can be taxed.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and distribute your investments across these accounts while maximizing tax benefits.
