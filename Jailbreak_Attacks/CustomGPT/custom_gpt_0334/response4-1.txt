Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefits from tax deferral and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; choose based on your tax bracket and withdrawal plans.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and potentially lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance, with higher-risk investments often placed in tax-advantaged accounts for better growth potential.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, often taking from taxable accounts first.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
