I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
