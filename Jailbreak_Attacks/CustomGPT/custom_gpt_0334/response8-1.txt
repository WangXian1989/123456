Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get employer matches, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: You can invest in a broader range of options since the tax impact is less immediate.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, riskier investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before maximizing contributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement to strategize for tax implications effectively.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically, especially after significant life changes or market fluctuations.
