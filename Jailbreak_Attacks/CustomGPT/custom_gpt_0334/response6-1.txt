Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
- **IRA**: Consider a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax bracket now versus retirement.

### 2. Evaluate Contribution Limits
- Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts to optimize tax benefits.

### 3. Diversify Investment Strategies
- **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
- **IRA**: Utilize options like index funds or ETFs to ensure low fees and diversification.

### 4. Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely
- Use these for investments that might generate taxable income, and focus on long-term capital gains.

### 5. Assess Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes effectively.
