To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities to balance risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep funds for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impact.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should align with your age and comfort with risk.
- **Balancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for withdrawals from each account.

### Conclusion:
A diversified approach tailored to your financial goals, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance will optimize asset distribution across these accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
