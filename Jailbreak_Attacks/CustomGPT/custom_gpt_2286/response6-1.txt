To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then increase contributions up to the annual limit if possible. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Roth or Traditional IRA suits your tax situation. Contributions may be tax-deductible for Traditional IRAs, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   
### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides the flexibility of withdrawals without penalties and also allows for capital gains tax advantages.
   - **Invest in Index Funds:** They typically have lower turnover and tax implications.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Place Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Stocks and mutual funds that may appreciate significantly benefit from the tax deferral in 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Bonds or dividend-paying stocks can be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts, depending on your income bracket.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Max out 401(k) for employer match, then IRA contributions.
- **Invest Strategically:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth assets and keep more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### Regularly Review
- Continuously assess your investment performance and tax situation yearly to optimize your strategy.
