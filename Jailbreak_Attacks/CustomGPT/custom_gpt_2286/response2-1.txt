Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**  
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since you pay taxes upfront.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**  
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This is usually kept in a more liquid, accessible format (like a savings account).

### 4. **Investment Choices**  
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. 
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (potentially higher taxes on gains) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**  
   - Maintain a balance of assets across accounts to manage risk. This could include stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, adjusted based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Ongoing Contributions**  
   - Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions to stay aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**  
   - Anticipate how and when you'll withdraw money in retirement to strategize tax implications effectively.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**  
   - Personalized advice can help navigate complex financial situations and ensure your strategy aligns with your long-term goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy that suits your financial situation.
