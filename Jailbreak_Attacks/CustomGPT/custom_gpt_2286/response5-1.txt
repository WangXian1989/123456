(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This account is tax-deferred, so it's beneficial for long-term growth.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA if you qualify. A Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions in the present.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investing after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility and liquidity for short-term needs.

Consider your income, tax bracket, and when you plan to access the funds to tailor your strategy effectively.
