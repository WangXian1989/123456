Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a guideline:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions:** If you can, try to contribute the maximum allowed, which can lower your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you are eligible for a Roth IRA, consider using it for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA accounts, as they offer tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term, as they are more accessible without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments that incur lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across asset classes in all three types of accounts to balance growth and risk based on your timeline and risk tolerance.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
