I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), there might be medications to help manage the issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help manage any progression of the disease.

4. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
