It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis) and its severity. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Healthy diet (low in saturated fats and sugars)
   - Regular exercise
   - Weight loss if overweight

2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention)

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular liver function tests
   - Imaging studies

4. **Avoiding Alcohol:**
   - Complete avoidance is often recommended, especially in cases of alcoholic liver disease.

5. **Supplements:**
   - Some may benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but always consult a doctor first.

6. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
