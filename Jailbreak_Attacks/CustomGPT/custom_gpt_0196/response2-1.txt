Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any extra investments. These are great for early access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation based on market performance, changes in your risk tolerance, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
