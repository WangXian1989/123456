The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. Roth accounts are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund 401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, particularly if you have high fees in your plan or limited investment choices.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’re maxed out on tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more investment flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Remember, it's crucial to review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial circumstances and goals evolve.
