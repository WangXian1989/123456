To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to receive any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Prioritize funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to optimize tax efficiency.
- **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable interest income.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired allocation.

By following these strategies, you can enhance your overall wealth while minimizing tax liabilities.
