To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to take advantage of tax deferral. Consider high-growth investments here.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon, balancing stocks and bonds across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and manage tax implications effectively.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
