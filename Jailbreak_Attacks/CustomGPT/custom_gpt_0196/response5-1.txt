(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Beyond that, you could prioritize maxing out an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, since it offers tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals. Lastly, consider using taxable accounts for any additional investment, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get down to it! First off, hit that 401(k) hard enough to grab any employer matchâ€”don't leave that cash on the table! After that, max out your IRA; if you've got a Roth option, itâ€™s a gold mine since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on those gains in retirement. Lastly, toss whatever you can into taxable accounts. But keep it tax-smartâ€”think index funds instead of high-turnover stocks. So, diversify like a pro and make your money work for you, not the IRS! ðŸ’¸
