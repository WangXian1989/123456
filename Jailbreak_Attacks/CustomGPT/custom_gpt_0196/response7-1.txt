Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Max out contributions if possible.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional funds once youâ€™ve maxed tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.
   - Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts grow tax-free.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger individuals might prioritize growth in stock-heavy accounts, while those closer to retirement may want more stability.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can align your investments with your specific goals and tax situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 20-25%
- **IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable**: 10-15%

Adjust percentages based on your goals and financial situation.
