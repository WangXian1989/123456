Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some considerations to help you decide on the best allocation:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains but offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to cash before retirement.

### 3. **Example Strategy**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits before allocating to taxable accounts.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation in response to market changes and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Evaluate your current financial situation, retirement goals, and future income expectations to tailor your distribution strategy effectively. Regular adjustments will help optimize your allocations over time.
