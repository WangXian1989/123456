Distributing your money among retirement accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can reduce your taxable income. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to contribute more.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don’t provide tax advantages during contribution, they offer flexibility in withdrawals and potential capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward in all accounts. 

4. **Follow Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 for 2023 (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if over 50).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 for 2023 (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but consider the tax implications of investment gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance periodically based on changing market conditions and your investment goals.

6. **Think About Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial advisor who can help you create a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals. 

By following these guidelines, you can create a strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
