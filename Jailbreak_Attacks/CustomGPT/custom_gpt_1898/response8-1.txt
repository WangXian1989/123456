The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) can give you a tax deduction now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts require after-tax contributions but allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Determine Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you’re saving for short-term goals (0-5 years), keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals (10+ years), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds. Generally, it’s advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

6. **Consider Future Income Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing cash before retirement, lean more on taxable accounts.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**:
   - Your situation may change (e.g., income, tax laws, investment performance), so regularly revisit your strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial planner can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
