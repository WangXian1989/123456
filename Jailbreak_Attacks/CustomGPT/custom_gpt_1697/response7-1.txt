Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your retirement savings and minimizing taxes. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### **1. Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### **2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on maxing out contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts if you can. They offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not.
     - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet the income requirements.
     - **401(k):** If your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option, you can also consider that based on your tax situation.

### **3. Balance Contributions:**
   - Once you’ve captured the full 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you can contribute to both, determine your annual limits for each.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### **4. Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-efficient investing strategies, keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### **5. Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution approach based on your changing financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

### **Conclusion:**
This strategy should help you optimize your investments while taking advantage of tax benefits. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
