To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Traditional contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferral.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Choose investments based on time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, longer-term investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid, lower-risk investments may belong in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place bonds and funds with high turnover in tax-advantaged accounts, and hold stocks and ETFs in taxable accounts for potential lower long-term capital gains taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial professional can help tailor strategies to your specific financial situation.

This distribution approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility.
