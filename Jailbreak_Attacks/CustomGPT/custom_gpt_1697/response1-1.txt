Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Diversification of Tax Treatment:** Consider having both to balance your tax burden in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Use these for flexibility and emergencies.
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Focus on assets that benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have three to six months of expenses saved outside these accounts.
- **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Annual Review:** Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

### Suggested Allocation:
A common guideline is the "100 minus age" rule for stocks in retirement accounts, adjusting for individual risk tolerance. For example, if you're 30, you might hold 70% in stocks across your 401(k) and IRA.

### Tax Considerations:
- Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type.
- Be aware of contribution limits and penalties for early withdrawals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
