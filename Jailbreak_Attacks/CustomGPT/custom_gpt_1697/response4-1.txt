When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also allows pre-tax contributions, with similar tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment profits are taxed when realized, affecting capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for 2023.
   - **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.
   - **Taxable accounts**: No contribution limits, but taxes apply to gains.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Retirement accounts**: Have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more advantageous given your current tax situation. If you're eligible, max out an IRA after funding your 401(k) match.

3. **Fill up the 401(k)**: After funding the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Allocate Extra Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in your taxable account for flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 30% of your investing budget
- **IRA**: 20%
- **Roth IRA (if eligible)**: 10%
- **Taxable accounts**: 40%

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits, retirement savings, and access to funds as needed. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
