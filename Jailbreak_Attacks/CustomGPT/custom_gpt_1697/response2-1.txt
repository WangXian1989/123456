Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

3. **Tax-efficient investing in taxable accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Avoid holding high-turnover funds or taxable bonds here to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider your tax bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA). Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

5. **Diversification and flexibility:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be crucial for emergency funds or short-term needs.

6. **Rebalance as needed:** Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your investment goals.
