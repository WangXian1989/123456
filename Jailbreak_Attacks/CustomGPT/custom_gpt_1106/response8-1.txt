To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize it, then consider your tax bracket when making additional contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (for immediate tax benefits) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If eligible, max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable accounts, especially for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your intended distribution.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy or have a complex financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.
