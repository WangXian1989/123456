Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can lead to compound growth over time:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional or Roth; consider the match and tax implications.
   - **IRA**: Traditional or Roth; consider income limits for Roth contributions.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before allocating more funds to investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. You can hold different asset classes or strategies in each account type.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Planning**: Consider your future needs for withdrawals. If you plan to retire early, you might want to focus more on IRA assets, which can be accessed without penalties after age 59½.

7. **Regular Review**: Review your allocation regularly and adjust as your financial situation changes, such as job changes, increases in salary, or changes in tax law.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: This is especially advisable if you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific financial situation.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your funds among these types of accounts.
