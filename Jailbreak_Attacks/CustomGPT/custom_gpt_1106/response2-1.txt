To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs, tax-deferred until withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profits and interest income taxes. Use this account for investments you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Risk Assessment and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. For example, stocks might be more appropriate in a tax-advantaged account, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your distribution strategy and investment performance. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts early, which could incur penalties.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient allocation that works towards your long-term financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this general strategy to your specific situation.
