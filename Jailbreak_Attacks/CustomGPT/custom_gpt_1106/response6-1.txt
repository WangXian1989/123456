Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income now or later. 

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations:** A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These offer the most flexibility and can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be mindful of the tax implications on earnings. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### **Suggested Distribution Approach**
- **Maximize Retirement Accounts First:**
  - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
  - After that, consider fully funding an IRA (especially a Roth, if eligible).

- **Allocate Remaining Funds:**
  - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income (which can be taxed) or for funds you might need before retirement.

### **Considerations**
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement should focus on preservation.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your comfort with market fluctuations to determine asset allocation.

### **Conclusion**
Start with employer matches and tax-advantaged accounts before using taxable accounts, adjusting the percentage based on personal financial goals and statuses. Regularly review your strategy to optimize your financial future.
