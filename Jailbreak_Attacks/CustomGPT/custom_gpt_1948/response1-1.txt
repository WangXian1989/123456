To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts allow tax-deferred growth.
   - **After-Tax Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, depending on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments might be better in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, getting personalized advice can help maximize your overall tax efficiency and growth potential.

Adjust these strategies based on your individual financial goals, age, and risk tolerance.
