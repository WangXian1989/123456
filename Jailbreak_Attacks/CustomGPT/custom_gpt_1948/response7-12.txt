I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Interventional Procedures**: In more severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even surgery may be necessary.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are vital to assess liver function and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and discuss any treatment options thoroughly.
