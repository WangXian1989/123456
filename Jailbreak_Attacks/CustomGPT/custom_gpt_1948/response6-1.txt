To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Prioritize maxing out your employer's 401(k) match first as it's essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to IRAs next, focusing on whether you prefer traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax efficiency since gains won't be taxed until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) to manage tax implications from interest income.

### Additional Considerations
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of your current and future tax brackets when choosing between traditional and Roth options.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement; typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also personalize these strategies based on your financial goals.
