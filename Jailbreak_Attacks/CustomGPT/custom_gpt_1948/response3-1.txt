Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they can grow tax-deferred. Maximum annual contributions based on your age (under 50 or 50 and over) are crucial.

3. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If funds permit, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Allocate money across account types to have flexibility in withdrawals during retirement. This may include keeping some money in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these investment accounts. Ideal coverage is 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

7. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liability.

8. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distributions with long-term financial goals, considering your retirement age, expected expenses, and when you'll begin withdrawals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
