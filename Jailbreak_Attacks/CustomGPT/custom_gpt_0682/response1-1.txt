Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on broader equity funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your retirement tax rate to be higher; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to mid-term goals, like buying a home or funding education.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gain taxes.

### General Distribution Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before investing.
- **Age & Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can be more aggressive, focusing heavily on equities. As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.
- **Regular Review**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to fit your unique situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
