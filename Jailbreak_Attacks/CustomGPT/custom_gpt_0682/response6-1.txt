Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your investment strategy, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) to take advantage of free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**:
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering taxable income now.
     - Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement, typically at a lower tax rate if you’re in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold.
     - Interest and dividends are taxed annually, so consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Higher-risk assets may be better suited in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Stabilize risk in taxable accounts with more conservative investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment goals.
   - Reallocating assets across your accounts can help manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts last to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Use taxable accounts for early retirement or significant expenses, reducing penalties from early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this distribution strategy to your specific situation.
