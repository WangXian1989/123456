Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income level, tax situation, and investment goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Pay Down High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debts, prioritize paying these off before allocating more funds to investments.

4. **Max Out 401(k) Contribution**: After getting the match and contributing to your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit if possible.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility but come with capital gains tax on realized gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, and adjust allocations based on the account type (e.g., more aggressive in a 401(k) versus conservative in a taxable account).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk profile.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
