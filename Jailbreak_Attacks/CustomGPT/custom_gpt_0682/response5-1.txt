(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribution limits, and the match amount should be your first priority, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) after meeting the employer match in your 401(k). This may provide tax benefits depending on the account type.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once the tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, you can allocate additional funds toward taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified and periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy appropriate for your specific needs.

1. **401(k) First**: First thingâ€™s first, max out that employer match! Free cash is your best friend. Go for the full match before throwing money into anything else. Itâ€™s like scoring a bonus at work!

2. **IRA Power**: After youâ€™ve milked that 401(k) dry, dive into your IRA. If you can, go Roth for the long-term gains and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, consider a Traditional IRA to reduce your taxable income today.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve tackled the tax benches, itâ€™s time for your taxable accounts. You get that sweet liquidity and freedom to withdraw without penalties. Perfect for spontaneous trips or emergency cash.

4. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t forget to diversify! Spread that money like itâ€™s Nutella on toastâ€”smoothly and evenly. Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance as needed to keep things in check.
