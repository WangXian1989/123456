The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Especially if you have an employer match, prioritize this account. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be funded after maxing out your contributions to retirement accounts. They're flexible and offer liquidity, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified. Avoid holding the same investments in multiple accounts, as this can lead to inefficiencies.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can build a balanced strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and tax considerations.
