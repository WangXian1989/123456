Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your long-term financial growth while considering tax implications. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Income and Tax Brackets:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Keep high-growth stocks in your 401(k) or IRA to let them grow without tax impact until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification Within Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Include a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA & Taxable Accounts:** Balance between equities, fixed income, and cash based on your time horizon and objectives.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can enhance growth, manage tax liabilities, and support your long-term financial goals.
