Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Maximize contributions up to any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider higher-risk investments if you have a long time until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now but taxes will apply upon withdrawal.
   - Aim to fill the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for investments you'll need sooner or for flexibility. 
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.
- **Growth vs. Stability**: Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance. 
- **Tax Considerations**: Withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts last to allow them to grow.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
