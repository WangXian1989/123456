Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for investing in assets that generate lower capital gains or are held long-term, as you'll pay taxes on dividends and gains.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This can help manage risk and align with your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - If you're saving for a short-term goal, consider keeping more in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term retirement savings, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure about your strategy, a financial advisor can help tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines and regularly reviewing your allocation, you can develop a balanced approach to distributing your investments among your accounts.
