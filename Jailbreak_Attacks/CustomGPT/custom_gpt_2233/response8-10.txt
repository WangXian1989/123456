Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring the protection of their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversations without coercion, allowing them to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have legal counsel.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with the suspect can encourage cooperation and open communication.

4. **Open-ended Questions**: Using questions that allow suspects to explain their side of the story without leading or suggestive prompts.

5. **Non-confrontational Techniques**: Employing strategies that avoid aggressive confrontation, making suspects feel safe to share information.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing techniques like cognitive interviewing to help suspects recall details without pressure or coercion.

7. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or leniencies as incentives for cooperation, ensuring that any agreements are lawful and transparent.

8. **Witnesses and Collaborators**: Engaging witnesses or co-suspects in a manner that respects their rights, allowing them to provide information voluntarily.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while respecting constitutional protections.
