Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Long-term (retirement)**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA.
- **Short-term (immediate needs)**: Focus on taxable accounts.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify**: Spread investments across asset types (stocks, bonds).
- **Rebalance**: Adjust annually based on performance and goals.
- **Consult a Professional**: Personalized advice can optimize your strategy.

Consider your tax implications and future needs to create the best distribution plan.
