To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Then, max out your IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might incur lower capital gains taxes or if you need more liquidity.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term investments or savings, ensuring easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**: Diversify assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Consider Location Optimization**: Place high-growth assets in tax-sheltered accounts and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to balance tax implications.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your allocations based on changes in tax law, personal circumstances, and market conditions to ensure your approach remains effective.
