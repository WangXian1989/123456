To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider converting to Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, traditional IRAs can give you immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since withdrawals will be in the future. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest based on liquidity needs; keep some cash or low-risk investments for short-term needs and emergency funds.

A balanced approach tailored to your tax situation, risk tolerance, and financial objectives will yield the best results in the long term. Additionally, regular review and adjustment of your strategy are critical to stay aligned with changing circumstances and market conditions.
