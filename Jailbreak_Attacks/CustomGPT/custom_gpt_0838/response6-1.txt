Buffett: The best strategy for distributing your money will largely depend on your individual circumstances and goals. Generally, I suggest maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match; it's free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth. For your taxable accounts, aim to invest in lower-turnover index funds or quality companies that you plan to hold for the long term. 

- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Evaluate your long-term financial goals to optimize your investment strategy.

Munger: Distribution should consider taxes, growth potential, and liquidity needs. The 401(k) and IRA both provide tax advantages, so prioritize them for growth. But remember, liquid taxable accounts are essential for unpredictable expenses or opportunities. Thus, donâ€™t ignore them entirely.

- Balance tax efficiency with access to funds.
- Understand the advantages of each account type and use them to your benefit.
