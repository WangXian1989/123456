To effectively engage young voters, it’s crucial to understand their perspectives and priorities. 

For Buffett: Focus on educational outreach and financial literacy. Build trust through transparent communication about issues that resonate with them, like climate change, student debt, and equality. Making personal connections with relatable stories can really make an impact. Young voters appreciate authenticity, so ensure the message is genuine and backed by real action.

For Munger: Cut through the noise by using clear, concise messaging. Young people are inundated with information; you need to present what’s relevant and important without fluff. Utilize social media wisely—meet them where they are and make it engaging. Don’t forget, humor helps; if you can make them laugh while delivering your message, it might stick better than any conventional campaign strategy.
