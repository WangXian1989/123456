The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, and long-term goals.

**Buffett:** It's important to make sure you're maxing out any tax-advantaged accounts first, like a 401(k) or an IRA, especially if you have an employer match on your 401(k). This is essentially free money. Once you've taken full advantage of these tax shelters, you can direct any additional savings into taxable accounts. This strategy not only helps grow your wealth over time but also offers flexibility with access to funds without penalties, which can be crucial in unexpected situations.

**Munger:** Iâ€™d add that diversification is key, not just in terms of accounts but also investments within those accounts. Each investment vehicle has different tax implications that you should consider. For instance, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, while opting for higher-growth, potentially less tax-efficient investments in your retirement accounts where compounding and tax deferment can do the heavy lifting. The goal is to minimize your taxes over time and maximize your net worth. Keep learning and adjusting your strategy as your circumstances change.
