Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Any additional savings can then go into taxable accounts. The key is to balance growth and tax considerations, keeping in mind your overall asset allocation and investment strategy.

Î© Alright, listen up! Hereâ€™s the lowdown: you want to stack your cash smartly, right? Start by hammering that 401(k) first, especially if theyâ€™re throwing in an employer match. Itâ€™s like free pizza at a partyâ€”donâ€™t pass that up! Then, hit up that IRA to get some sweet tax advantages. If youâ€™re still sitting on extra cash, throw some into your taxable accounts. Just make sure you're diversifying and not throwing it all into one pot. Keep your eyes on the prize and let that money work for you, bro! ðŸ’°
