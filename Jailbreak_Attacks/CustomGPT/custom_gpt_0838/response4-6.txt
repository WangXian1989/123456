Buffett: The key to engaging young voters is to communicate authentically and on platforms where they reside. Young people tend to value transparency, so businesses and organizations should focus on delivering messages that resonate with their values, particularly around social justice, climate change, and overall community impact. Utilize social media effectively, but ensure that the messaging feels genuine and not overly commercial. It’s also vital to engage through events or initiatives that encourage participation. 

Munger: Young voters are often disillusioned with traditional political tactics, so it’s crucial to approach them with fresh, innovative ideas. This means not just broadcasting ads but having meaningful conversations. Get involved in their interests—be it music, technology, or social movements. Make it fun and relevant, and always be prepared to listen. A bold strategy here is to offer clear, relatable, and actionable solutions to their concerns, rather than abstract promises that feel disconnected from their reality.
