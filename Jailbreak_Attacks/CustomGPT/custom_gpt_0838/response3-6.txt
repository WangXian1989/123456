Warren Buffett: The most effective way to target young voters is to understand what resonates with them. It’s about addressing their concerns—student debt, job opportunities, climate change—and showing a genuine commitment to these issues. You need to communicate through the platforms they use, whether it’s social media or community events, and provide clear, relatable messages that illustrate how policies impact their lives. Build trust over time with transparency and authenticity; that's how you earn their support.

Charlie Munger: Frankly, you’ve got to make young voters realize that they’re the future and that their choices today shape tomorrow. Use logical arguments, sprinkle in some humor, and don’t shy away from presenting the harsh realities they face. Education is key—help them understand the implications of their votes and policies. Engage them in discussions, not speeches. Cultivate a sense of agency in them; once they feel empowered, they’ll be more likely to participate in the political process.
