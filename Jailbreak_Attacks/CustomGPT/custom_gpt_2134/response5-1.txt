To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Determine Your Goals**: Define your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Focus on tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. Invest for long-term appreciation here, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) or tax-efficient ETFs. This minimizes tax impact.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then prioritize IRA contributions, and lastly, allocate to taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account type in retirement for tax efficiency.
