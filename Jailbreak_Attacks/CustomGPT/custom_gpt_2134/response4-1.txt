To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for retirement growth without immediate tax impact.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - *Traditional IRA*: Pre-tax contributions; taxes owed upon withdrawal.
     - *Roth IRA*: Post-tax contributions; withdrawals (qualified) are tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for goals outside retirement. Be cautious of capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to maintain discipline and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to adjust to market changes and personal goals.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline and other financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
