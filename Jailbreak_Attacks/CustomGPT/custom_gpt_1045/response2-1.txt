Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw at any time, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first (if available).
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation and whether you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Back to 401(k)**: Once IRAs are maxed or adequately funded, return to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for higher income years to lower taxable income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you may need before retirement, or for investing in tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Higher Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) in 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Stable Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Hold lower-growth or income-producing assets (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains and income taxes effectively.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Assess asset allocation yearly or after major life events. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Final Thoughts:
A balanced approach that considers immediate needs, tax efficiency, and long-term growth will maximize your retirement savings. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
