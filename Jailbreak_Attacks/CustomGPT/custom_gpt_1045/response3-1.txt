To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Primarily for long-term growth and tax-deferred growth. Choose higher-growth investments here since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing after-tax dollars for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions depending on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - Consider more conservative investments (bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan when and how to withdraw funds from each account type to optimize tax liabilities in retirement.

This structured approach can help maximize your investments and minimize taxes over time.
