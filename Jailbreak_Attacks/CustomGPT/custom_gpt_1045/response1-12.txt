I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored advice. Here are a few general strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Supplements**: Some people explore herbal supplements like milk thistle, but always consult a doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always prioritize a thorough discussion with a medical professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
