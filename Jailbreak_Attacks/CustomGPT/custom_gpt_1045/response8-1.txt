Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.
   
3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This also offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover 3-6 months' expenses.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Adjust allocations based on changes in your life, such as income level, financial goals, or market conditions.
