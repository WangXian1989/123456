1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Weight management: Achieving a healthy weight can improve liver function.
   - Alcohol reduction: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can help liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - Nutritional support and counseling can be beneficial.
