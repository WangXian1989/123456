Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed when realized, but they can be more flexible for withdrawals.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a **Roth IRA** for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your income to rise.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), considering fees and expense ratios associated with each account type.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep enough funds in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs since they are easily accessible.

### 6. **Long-Term Growth Focus**
   - Aim for higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth will not be taxed until withdrawal.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust the allocations annually to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 8. **Consider Your Age**
   - Younger investors might focus on growth (higher allocation in stocks), while those approaching retirement might prioritize stability (bonds and cash).

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% (ensure to max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 10% (Roth or traditional, based on eligibility)
- **Taxable Account**: 10% (for flexibility and quick access)
- **Remaining Amount**: Adjust based on goals and risk tolerance.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
