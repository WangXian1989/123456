To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match to leverage free money. Consider maxing it out if you can.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer traditional, consult on potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Focus on higher-growth investments, as withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your tax strategy, mix between stocks and bonds according to risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) and consider capital gains implications.

### 3. **Balance for Flexibility**
   - Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, while still maximizing growth in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess and adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Diversify investments based on tax implications.
- Maintain a balance for immediate and long-term needs.
