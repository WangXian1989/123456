Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns:

   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) can be held in taxable accounts where long-term capital gains rates are typically lower.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
