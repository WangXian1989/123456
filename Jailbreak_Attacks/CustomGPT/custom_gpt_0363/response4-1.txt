Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Rate**:
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth or tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you plan to retire early, consider how withdrawals and penalties might affect your accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in financial goals or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
