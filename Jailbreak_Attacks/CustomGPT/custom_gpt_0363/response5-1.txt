Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it a good choice for younger investors or those expecting higher earnings later.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to manage tax liabilities. Investments here can be more flexible, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make adjustments based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
