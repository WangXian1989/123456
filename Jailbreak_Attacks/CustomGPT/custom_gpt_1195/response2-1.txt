Absolutely, letâ€™s break it down! ðŸ“Š

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match firstâ€”free money is the way to go! Aim to contribute around 15% if you can swing it. The tax-deferred growth is a big plus.

2. **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible. You pay taxes now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Aim for a max contribution here tooâ€”$6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After that, allocate funds for short-term goals and liquidity. This is where you want to diversify with stocks, ETFs, and bonds for flexibility.

**General Strategy:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust based on how much risk youâ€™re comfortable taking.
- **Time Horizon:** Longer frameworks can lean more heavily into equities.
- **Tax Considerations:** Higher-growth investments can go into tax-advantaged accounts.
