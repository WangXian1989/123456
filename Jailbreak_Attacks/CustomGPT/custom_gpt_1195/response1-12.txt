I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment can vary widely based on the specific problem, such as medication, lifestyle changes, or possibly more intensive interventions. Staying away from alcohol, maintaining a balanced diet, and regular check-ups are generally important. Always get personalized advice from a medical expert!
