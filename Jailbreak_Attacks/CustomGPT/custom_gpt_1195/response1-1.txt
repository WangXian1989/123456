To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these smart strategies:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Start with your 401(k) and IRA contributions. These accounts offer tax benefits that can boost your investment growth.
  
2. **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. It's free money, so don’t leave that on the table!

3. **Consider Types of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Ideal for saving for retirement with potential employer matches. Great for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax advantages for individuals. Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for goals outside of retirement or when you want more flexibility. Keep investments that might generate higher taxable income in these accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your allocations and adjust them as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Withdrawals and Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of when and how you withdraw funds from these accounts to minimize tax impact.

Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation. Happy investing!
