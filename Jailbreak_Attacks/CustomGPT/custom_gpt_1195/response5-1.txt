(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, hereâ€™s a good approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can, especially if your employer offers a good selection of low-cost funds.
   
2. **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions. Try to maximize these accounts, as they usually offer more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings. Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments here, so focus on tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs.

Balancing your investments in line with your risk tolerance and time horizon is key. You might also want to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
