I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications might also be prescribed depending on the specific liver issue. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs. Always reach out to your healthcare provider for the best guidance!
