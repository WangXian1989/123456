Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer 401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income**: If your income is below certain thresholds, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Good for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Capital gains taxes apply to profits. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside before investing.
2. **401(k)**: Aim to maximize the employer match first.
3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing the match, consider funding your IRA.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and growth.

### Rebalance Regularly:
Monitor and adjust your investments based on performance and shifts in your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
