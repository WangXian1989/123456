Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Use 401(k) for Higher Contribution Limits**: After maximizing your match, consider directing additional funds to your 401(k) for its higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Put investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and hold equities in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund in Taxable Accounts**: Keep a portion of your funds in taxable accounts for easier access in case of emergencies.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regularly Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations, especially as your income, expenses, and goals change over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this distribution strategy to your personal circumstances and objectives.
