Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access in the short term or that you'd like more flexibility on regarding taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, considering asset classes and risk levels to balance your investments.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Assess and adjust your allocations periodically based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
