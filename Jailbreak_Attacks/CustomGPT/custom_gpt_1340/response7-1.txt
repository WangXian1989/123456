Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### **1. Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### **2. Consider Tax Treatment:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Best for long-term growth while deferring taxes. These are effective if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Ideal if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made after-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free if qualified.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for goals with a shorter time frame. They offer more flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### **3. Prioritize Debt Repayment:**
   - Pay down high-interest debt before investing heavily in retirement accounts to maximize financial health.

### **4. Diversify Investment:**
   - Within your accounts, ensure a diversified portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### **5. Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before committing most to investments.

### **6. Evaluate Your Goals and Timeline:**
   - Short-term goals (buying a house, etc.): More funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term goals (retirement): More funds in 401(k) and IRAs.

### **7. Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio, contribution limits, and tax implications to adapt to your evolving financial situation.
