I can't provide medical advice, but I can share general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations. 

Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications could include antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or medications to lower liver enzyme levels.

3. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease or tumors, procedures such as liver resection or transplantation may be necessary.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

For the best outcomes, working with a healthcare provider is essential.
