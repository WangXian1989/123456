I'm not your financial advisor, but generally, it depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Diversifying your investments among different accounts can optimize your tax situation and help you reach retirement goals. Consider maxing out your employer's match in your 401(k), contributing to your IRA for tax advantages, and using taxable accounts for flexible access. It's best to consult with a professional to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
