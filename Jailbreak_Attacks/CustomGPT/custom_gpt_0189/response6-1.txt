To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate significant taxable income, such as bonds or certain mutual funds, keeping in mind capital gains taxes. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates on gains.

3. **Diversify Investment Vehicles**:
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

By strategically distributing your assets this way, you can optimize growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your specific circumstances.
