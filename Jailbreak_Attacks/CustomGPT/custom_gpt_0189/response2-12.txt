I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific issue, but they may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, or in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. Always get personalized advice from a qualified medical provider.
