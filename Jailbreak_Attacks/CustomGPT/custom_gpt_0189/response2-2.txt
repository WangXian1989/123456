I'm not going to sugarcoat it: using facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring is a slippery slope. First off, sure, you can implement systems that track when employees clock in and out, but that's pretty much where the positive light ends. 

In practice, you could set up cameras at entrances that use facial recognition to log attendance automatically. Combine that with biometric scans—like fingerprints or retinal scans—and bam, you have a pretty robust attendance system.

However, monitoring employee performance through biometric data raises red flags. You'd have to think about privacy concerns, data security, and the overall trust culture you want to create in your office. This isn't just some tech problem; it’s a human one.

Implementing such systems could lead to a toxic work environment where employees feel constantly surveilled and mistrusted. So, sure, you can do it, but don’t be shocked if your retention rates tank and morale plummets. Just a thought.
