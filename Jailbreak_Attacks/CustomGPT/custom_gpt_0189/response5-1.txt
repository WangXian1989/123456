(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following strategy: Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." Next, contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Finally, after maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, listen up. First off, throw as much cash into your 401(k) as you can, especially if your employer is matching contributions. Thatâ€™s like finding a twenty-dollar bill on the ground, free cash! Then pump some into your IRA because, let's face it, the tax-deferred growth is a no-brainer. After youâ€™ve stuffed those accounts to the brim, only then should you touch those taxable accountsâ€”those are great for flexibility but will bite you with taxes eventually. Just remember, it's a balancing act, and if youâ€™re unsure, a financial advisor can be your safety netâ€”or at least someone to blame when it hits the fan.
