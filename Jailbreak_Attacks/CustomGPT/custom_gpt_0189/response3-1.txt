Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax strategy, retirement goals, and investment options available in each account. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maxing out the employer match on your 401(k), consider making contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The type of IRA you choose can depend on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions may lower your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from long-term capital gains.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and gains.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to meet risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance annually or semi-annually to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Withdrawals in Retirement:**
   - Plan which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement to optimize your tax situation.
