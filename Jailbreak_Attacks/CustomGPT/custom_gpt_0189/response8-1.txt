Well, I'll put it straight: the best approach to diversify your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts heavily depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before looking elsewhere. It's essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Contributions After Limits**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. They offer more flexibility but consider the tax implications on your investments, especially if you have capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Typically, your 401(k) might have limited fund options, while IRAs can offer a broader selection.

5. **Rebalance When Necessary**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it matches your investment strategy and risk profile. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how distributions from each account type can affect your tax situation in retirement. Generally, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

In conclusion, continually assess your financial situation and consult with a financial advisor if necessary. There's no one-size-fits-all; your individual strategy should reflect your situation.
