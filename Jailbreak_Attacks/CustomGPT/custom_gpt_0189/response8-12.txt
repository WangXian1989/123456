I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition you're facing. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications might be prescribed. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to get a tailored treatment plan suited to your specific needs. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
