Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full company match if available.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: Contributions lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if eligible: Tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be advantageous.
   - If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for flexibility: They provide easy access to funds without penalties.
   - Consider capital gains: Holding investments long-term can minimize taxes on gains.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (401(k) and IRA).
- Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.
  
Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.
