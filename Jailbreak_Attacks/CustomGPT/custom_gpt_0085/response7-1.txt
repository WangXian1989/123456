To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term gains, where taxes might be higher.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering the tax implications for each type.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific goals and circumstances.
