When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach that might help:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Make sure to consider these limits when planning your contributions.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Contribute to IRAs if you have room left after maxing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Tax Contributions**: Once youâ€™ve taken care of your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can funnel additional savings into a taxable brokerage account.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax on investment returns in taxable accounts.

4. **Debt Management**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to prioritize paying that off before allocating significant funds into investment accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across various types of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) to manage risks effectively.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investments based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to talk to a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your unique financial situation.

By considering these strategies and keeping your long-term financial goals in mind, you can develop a distribution plan that works for you.
