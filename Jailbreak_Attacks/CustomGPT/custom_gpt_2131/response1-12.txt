I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and your overall health. Generally, common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver conditions (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and possibly imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures to remove blockages or even liver transplants may be considered.

5. **Hepatitis Vaccination**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B if you're at risk.

Please consult with a healthcare provider who can provide you with tailored treatment options based on your specific health needs.
