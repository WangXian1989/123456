Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
2. **Lifestyle changes**: Incorporating a healthy diet, abstaining from alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can be beneficial for liver health.

For the best results, please seek advice from a medical professional who is familiar with your health history.
