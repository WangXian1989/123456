Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. If your income is eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - Roth accounts require after-tax contributions but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Set Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance and timeline. 
   - Generally, your more aggressive investments can go in your tax-advantaged accounts, and more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest and dividends.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on changes in life circumstances, market conditions, and to ensure you are on track with your retirement goals.

6. **Other Factors**:
   - Consider future tax implications of withdrawals from your accounts.
   - Emergency funds should be kept separate from these investments for liquidity.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
