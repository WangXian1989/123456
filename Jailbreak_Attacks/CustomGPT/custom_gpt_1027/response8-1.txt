To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible, and any earnings grow tax-deferred. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Long-term holdings (over a year) generally incur lower tax rates.

### Overall Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an accessible emergency fund, typically in a savings or money market account.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place investments with high growth potential and low turnover in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to minimize taxable events.
- **Diversify**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all account types.
  
### Check Contribution Limits:
Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions to maximize tax advantages.

### Regular Reviews:
Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with changes in market conditions and your financial goals. 

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Always adjust your strategy based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and retirement timeline!
