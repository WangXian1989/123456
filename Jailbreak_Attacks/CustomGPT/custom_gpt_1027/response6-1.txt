Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Characteristics**
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching, tax-deferred growth; good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers potential tax advantages; can be a Traditional or Roth, impacting withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for short-term needs; subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match; this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Tax Efficiency Strategy**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts to defer taxes until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Allocate more to equities in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Consider more conservatively in taxable accounts to reduce volatility.

### 5. **Adjust Contributions by Age**
   - **Younger Individuals**: More in growth-oriented assets (stocks), using 401(k) and IRA primarily.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards stability (bonds, cash equivalents) in all account types.

### 6. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly reassess your distribution based on market performance, changes in your financial goals, or significant life events.

By considering these strategies, you'll be better equipped to create a balanced and effective investment distribution plan.
