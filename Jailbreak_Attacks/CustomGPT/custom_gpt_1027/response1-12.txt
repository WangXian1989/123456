I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Certain medications can help manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. Make sure to follow a doctor's prescription.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your healthcare provider first.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and make adjustments to your treatment plan as needed.
5. **Surgery**: In more severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
