Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next, focusing on tax benefits (tax-deferred growth for traditional and tax-free withdrawals for Roth).

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider placing high-growth or high-income-producing investments (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

3. **Determine Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in all accounts collectively.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - When you begin withdrawals, consider the tax implications. Start with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts for longer.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Strategize how much to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts versus taxable accounts based on your tax situation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your goals.

7. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Consider your overall retirement strategy and potential estate planning needs regarding how funds are distributed.

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
