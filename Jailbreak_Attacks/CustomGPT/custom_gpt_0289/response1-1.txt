To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover index funds or long-term capital gains assets.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when youâ€™ll access funds, as tax implications differ by account type.

Consult a financial advisor for a personalized approach based on your individual circumstances.
