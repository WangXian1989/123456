I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options generally include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Eliminate or significantly reduce alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis or viral infections.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Discuss options like milk thistle with your doctor.

3. **Regular Check-ups**: Maintain monitoring through blood tests and imaging to assess liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, consider liver transplant as an option if other treatments fail.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
