To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, making them ideal for long-term investments.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue funding your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit. Any extra funds can go into taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as bonds or actively managed funds.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure diverse asset allocation across accountsâ€”stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or real estate in taxable accounts might be wise.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your investment strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
