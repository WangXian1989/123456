Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a recommended approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):**
   - Increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after funding your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your investment distribution for long-term growth and tax benefits.
