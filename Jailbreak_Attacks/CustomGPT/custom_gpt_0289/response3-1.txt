Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match and consider maxing it out to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts to cover emergencies (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like municipal bonds) or for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - Younger investors might lean more towards growth assets, while those closer to retirement may prioritize income and preservation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that optimizes your savings while considering tax implications and liquidity needs.
