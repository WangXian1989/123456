I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modification, exercise, and weight management are crucial for conditions like fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease type, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are important to monitor the diseaseâ€™s progression.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment plans.
