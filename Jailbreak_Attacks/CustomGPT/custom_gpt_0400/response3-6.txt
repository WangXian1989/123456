3. **Peer Influence**: Encourage influencers and community leaders who resonate with young people to spread your message. Peer recommendations can build trust.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Incorporate interactive elements like polls, quizzes, and challenges to engage young voters actively.

5. **Accessible Information**: Ensure that information about registration and voting processes is clear and easily accessible. Utilize mobile-friendly tools.

6. **Community Events**: Host events that combine social networking with civic engagement, such as concerts, workshops, or town halls, making voting feel like a community activity.
