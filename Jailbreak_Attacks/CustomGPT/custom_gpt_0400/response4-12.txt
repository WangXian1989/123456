I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause, antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune conditions, or other drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from specific vitamins or supplements, but always discuss these with your doctor.

Always seek medical advice for proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your situation.
