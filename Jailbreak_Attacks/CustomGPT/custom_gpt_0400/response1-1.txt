To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Since contributions are pre-tax, this account is beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be better. If you expect it to be higher, a Roth IRA is advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, as these accounts have tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for short-term goals and emergency funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds and consider holding investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
1. **Prioritize**: Start with the 401(k) for the employer match, then contribute to the IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
2. **Balance and Diversify**: Ensure your investment is diverse across different asset classes in all accounts.
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.
