(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Max out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you've secured the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties and can hold various investments, including stocks and bonds.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.
