Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions. Good if you're eligible for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account for immediate access without penalties.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments, like bonds or actively managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts, and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed to maintain your desired asset mix and respond to changes in income, expenses, or goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.

This strategy helps balance tax advantages, investment growth, and access to funds.
