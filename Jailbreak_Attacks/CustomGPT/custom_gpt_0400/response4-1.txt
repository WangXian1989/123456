The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA. Depending on your income, consider whether a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA is more beneficial.
   - Continue adding to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit after securing the match.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free, making them ideal for long-term growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider the tax efficiency of investments here.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for tax efficiency.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

6. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: The longer you have until retirement, the more aggressive you can be with your investments, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
