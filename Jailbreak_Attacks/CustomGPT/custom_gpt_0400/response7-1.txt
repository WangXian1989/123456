To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income limits and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For taxable accounts, focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. Be mindful of when you sell assets to optimize your tax situation.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and manage risk appropriately.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid withdrawing from retirement savings early.

6. **Future Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
