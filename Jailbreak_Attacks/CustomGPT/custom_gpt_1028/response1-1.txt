Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), consider maxing it out next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread across asset types (stocks, bonds) and sectors. Use tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments, as they'll benefit most from tax-free growth.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement plans.

5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Contribute regularly to all accounts, increasing amounts as your finances allow, while prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your allocations at least once a year to align with changes in your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
