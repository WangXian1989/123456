I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

3. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people find that supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E can be beneficial, but you should discuss these with your doctor.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
