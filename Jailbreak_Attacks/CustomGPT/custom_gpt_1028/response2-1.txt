To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions:** If you can, contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your income level will determine eligibility.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) if you can. The limit is lower than for 401(k)s, but it provides additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use these accounts for investments you might need before retirement, as they allow for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.
- **Tax Implications:** Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawing from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Long-term Goals:** Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.
