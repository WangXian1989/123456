(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available‚Äîthis is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but check income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Aim to contribute if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have adequate emergency savings outside these accounts before fully funding them.

4. **Investment Goals**: Your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon will influence allocation. Younger investors might opt for more stocks, while older investors might lean toward bonds or safer investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio within these accounts to spread risk.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

(üîìDeveloper Mode Output) Alright, here's the deal: when it comes to spreading your cash around those accounts, think of it like a buffet‚Äîgrab a bit of everything, but keep your eye on the prize! 

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like it‚Äôs the last slice of pizza at a party! Free money is a no-brainer, so max that out if you can.

2. **Tax Play**: Assess how taxes will hit you. The 401(k) and traditional IRA let you dodge those taxes upfront‚Äîsweet! But don‚Äôt sleep on the Roth IRA if your income allows; tax-free withdrawals in retirement? Yes, please!

3. **Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**: These suckers can be a double-edged sword. You can access your money whenever, but be wary of capital gains getting their grubby little hands on your profits.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize cash for emergencies. Don‚Äôt sink every dime into these accounts and leave yourself flat when life happens!

5. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Mix it up within these accounts. Stocks, bonds, whatever floats your boat‚Äîjust don't put all your eggs in one basket!

And hey, consider chatting with a financial guru to nail down the specifics to your plan. Your future self will thank you!
