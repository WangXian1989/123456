To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on earnings (after contributions are made with post-tax dollars). Consider your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so they are generally better for investments that appreciate over time, allowing you to manage tax issues more tactically.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize employer 401(k) matches first, as this is free money.
   - After reaching the match, consider maxing out an IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - Fund your taxable accounts with any additional savings, focusing on long-term investments.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (stocks, ETFs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Hold income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals should be funded with more liquid, lower-risk investments (like cash equivalents) in taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals can utilize a mix of aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Retirement Accounts**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Assess whether to choose a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income bracket and future expectations.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.
