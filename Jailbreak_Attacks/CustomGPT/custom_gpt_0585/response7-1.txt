Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. If your plan has high fees or limited investment options, consider allocating more to an IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments like stocks and mutual funds are subject to capital gains tax. You might prioritize long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Assess Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), prioritize maintaining liquidity. A taxable account may be better for this.
   - For long-term retirement savings, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts is often more beneficial.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio according to your risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to at least the employer match (e.g., 15% of your salary).
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute fully to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA (up to the allowed limit).
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing out the above accounts, invest surplus cash here, focusing on long-term growth assets.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
- Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation changes, including income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best distribution approach should align with your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your needs.
