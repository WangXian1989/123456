The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before directing excess funds into retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt (like credit cards), as the interest on this debt can outweigh investment returns.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth on investments, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions if you qualify.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA contributions, direct additional savings into your 401(k). This account has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for liquidity and for any short-term goals, but be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep an eye on tax consequences for the investments in your accounts. For instance, placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can minimize your tax burden.

7. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

8. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation changes (income increases, major life events) and adjust your contributions accordingly.

Ultimately, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial landscape and goals.
