To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit as it's effectively free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contribute to the Traditional IRA if you wish to reduce your taxable income now. If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - The 401(k) contributions reduce your current taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Diversify Tax Strategies**: Maintaining funds in taxable accounts provides flexibility, as you can take withdrawals without penalties and have greater access to your money should unexpected circumstances arise.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in accessible cash or a high-interest savings account to cover 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses.

6. **Invest Based on Risk Tolerance**: Within these accounts, allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon—stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and potentially safer investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio allocation periodically (at least annually) to stay aligned with your investment objectives and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, consider talking to a financial planner who can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

It’s essential to have a holistic view of your financial situation, and this distribution strategy can help optimize your growth while managing tax implications effectively.
