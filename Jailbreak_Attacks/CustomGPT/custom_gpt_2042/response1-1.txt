Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your IRA or Roth IRA next, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. This helps reduce your taxable income.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. The tax-deferral benefits can significantly enhance your long-term savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've reached your contribution limits for retirement accounts or need more liquidity, consider investing in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that you'll be liable for capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: Ensure you maintain a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Different accounts may offer different investment options.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they remain aligned with your financial objectives.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
