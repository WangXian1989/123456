To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) by contributing enough to benefit from any employer matching. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial for higher-income earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket post-retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose according to your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Use this account for short-term goals or investments that generate qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread risk by diversifying across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) in each account, taking into account the time horizon and risk tolerance for each investment.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk level.

5. **Prioritize Contributions**: Allocate funds according to your investment goals. If your employer offers a generous match, focus on maxing out the 401(k) first, followed by the IRA and then taxable accounts, based on your current situation.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of management fees in your 401(k) and IRA. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible to keep more of your returns.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy tailored to your financial goals.
