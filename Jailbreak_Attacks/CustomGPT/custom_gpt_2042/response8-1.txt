To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Contributions to these accounts can offer tax advantages that enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Assess Your Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available within your 401(k) and IRA. If the investment options in your 401(k) are limited or have high fees, consider investing more in your IRA once you’ve met your employer’s match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Fund your taxable accounts with any remaining savings after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but keep in mind that they are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Think about your current and expected future tax situation. For example, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, utilizing Roth accounts (either 401(k) or IRA) for tax-free withdrawals may be beneficial.

6. **Diversification of Accounts**: Maintaining a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) investments can offer strategic tax management in retirement, as you can choose which accounts to withdraw from based on your tax situation at that time.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
