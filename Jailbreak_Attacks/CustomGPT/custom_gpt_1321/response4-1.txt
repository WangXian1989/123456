The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and retirement plans. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and strategies for distribution:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Benefits**: Typically offer employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.” Then consider contributing enough to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**:
   - **Benefits**: Tax-advantaged retirement saving with more investment options than many 401(k) plans. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: After funding your 401(k) to receive the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Depending on your income level, decide whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is best for you. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access your funds without penalties when needed. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Strategy**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), use taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider strategies for tax efficiency, like focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a suitable emergency fund before investing.
- **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: High-interest debt should be prioritized over investing.
- **Age Consideration**: Younger investors might opt for more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might shift towards preserving capital in taxable accounts.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in goals, and market conditions.

In summary, a strategic approach typically starts with maximizing 401(k) contributions (especially if there's an employer match), then moving to IRA contributions, and finally directing funds into taxable accounts. Always consider your long-term financial goals, and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
