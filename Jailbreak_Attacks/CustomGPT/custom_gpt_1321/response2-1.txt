When planning how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which option fits your tax situation better.

3. **Further 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your employer match and contributing to your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you can. This is beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments beyond the above accounts. These can be beneficial for short-term goals or investments that you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where you hold certain types of investments. For instance, holding bonds (which may have higher tax implications) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) can be beneficial, while placing stocks in taxable accounts might be advantageous due to lower capital gains tax rates.

7. **Reassessment and Adjustment**: Periodically reassess your financial situation and adjust your contributions as your income, goals, or market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
