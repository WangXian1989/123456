To strategically distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several key factors, including tax implications, your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here is a structured approach to guide your decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as this is essentially free money. If your plan offers a Roth option, consider utilizing it for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Taxable Account Usage**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be funded after fully utilizing your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Align your contributions with your timeline. For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts. For short-term goals, maintain liquidity in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification and Allocation**:
   - **Risk Management**: Diversify investments across accounts to spread risk. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

Remember, the best distribution strategy is personalized, based on your individual financial situation and goals. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
