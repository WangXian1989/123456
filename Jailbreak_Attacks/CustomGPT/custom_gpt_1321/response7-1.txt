Investing across different account types—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—can optimize your tax strategy and overall returns. Here’s a general guideline on how to distribute your money amongst these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The type of IRA will depend on your income level and whether you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them an attractive option if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Once you've done the above, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, particularly if your employer does not offer a match but the plan has good investment options.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** If you have maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies when appropriate.

6. **Adjust Based on Your Financial Goals:** Your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals should influence how aggressively you allocate funds across these accounts. Younger investors might favor riskier investments with higher growth potential, while those closer to retirement may want to allocate more conservatively.

This approach should help you balance tax efficiency, accessibility, and growth potential. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation.
