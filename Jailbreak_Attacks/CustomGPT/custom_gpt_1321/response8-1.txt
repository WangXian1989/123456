To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax rate. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be advantageous to contribute to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investment opportunities that arise. These accounts can provide liquidity without penalties for early withdrawal but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments that are likely to generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes, while holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to take advantage of preferential tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify asset types across all accounts. Ensure an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and cash to align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Continually assess your investment distribution and adjust as necessary based on changing financial goals, market performance, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
