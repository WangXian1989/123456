The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income, but distributions will be taxed during retirement. Evaluate how much you might need in retirement to determine your contributions.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax structure to a 401(k), with potential for tax-deductible contributions and future taxable distributions.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across your accounts to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider the type of investments in each account, as taxable accounts might require more tax-efficient investments.

5. **Long-Term Needs vs. Short-Term Goals:** Allocate funds to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth while using taxable accounts for more immediate financial needs if required.

6. **Regular Review:** Regularly reassess your investment strategy and make adjustments as needed based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
