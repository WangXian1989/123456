To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 401(k)s, the limit for employee contributions in 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50).
   - IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: 
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that; it's essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as 401(k), but with income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals during retirement (if certain conditions are met) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends in the year they are received. Use this for flexibility or for money you may need in the short term.

4. **Investment Diversification**: 
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.
   - Consider placing more volatile investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It's often more beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: 
   - Periodically assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions, adjusting your allocations as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personal finance is complex; a certified financial planner can help tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.

Developing a comprehensive strategy that maximizes benefits while minimizing taxes will help optimize your long-term financial health.
