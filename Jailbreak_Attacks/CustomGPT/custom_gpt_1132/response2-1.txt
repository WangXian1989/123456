Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations related to tax implications, your retirement timeline, and overall investment goals. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement, which can significantly enhance your returns over time.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If available, consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA. Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Account Type Diversification**: Diversify your investments by keeping a mix of asset allocations across all three types of accounts. This can help manage risk and tax exposure.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for flexible access to funds and may include investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs. Be cautious of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments in these accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly assess the performance of your investments and your overall financial situation to make necessary adjustments.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies that take into account your entire financial picture, including tax implications.

Always ensure that you're aware of the contribution limits and rules specific to each account type, as these can affect your overall investment strategy.
