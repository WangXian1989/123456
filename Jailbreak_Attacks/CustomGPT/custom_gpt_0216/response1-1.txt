Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a breakdown of each account type, along with pros and cons to help you strategize your distribution:

### 1. 401(k)
**Pros:**
- Contributions may be tax-deferred, reducing taxable income.
- Potential employer match contributions.
- Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

**Cons:**
- Limited investment options based on the plan.
- Early withdrawal penalties if taken before age 59½ (with some exceptions).

### 2. IRA (Traditional or Roth)
**Traditional IRA**
**Pros:**
- Contributions may be tax-deductible.
- Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
  
**Cons:**
- Early withdrawal penalties (with exceptions).
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start at age 72.

**Roth IRA**
**Pros:**
- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- No RMDs during the account owner’s lifetime.

**Cons:**
- Income limits on contributions.
- Contributions are not tax-deductible.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
**Pros:**
- Flexibility to withdraw funds at any time without penalties.
- No contribution limits.
- Potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains (holding investments for over a year).

**Cons:**
- No tax advantages for contributions.
- Earnings subject to capital gains tax in the year they're realized.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions – it's essentially free money.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if your income allows for it. It provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After hitting the IRA balance, contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you are still within a tax-deferred situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, you can consider investing in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Considerations
- **Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you might want to adjust how much you contribute to tax-deferred versus after-tax accounts (like Roth IRAs).
  
- **Time Horizon**: The longer your investment horizon, the more you might want to focus on tax-advantaged accounts, as the compounding effect can help you overcome early withdrawal penalties and other limitations.

- **Investment Goals**: Tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial goals, whether it’s for early retirement, buying a home, or other significant expenditures.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific needs and condition. Happy strategizing!
