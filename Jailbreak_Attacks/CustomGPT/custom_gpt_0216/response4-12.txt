I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider who can give you personalized advice and treatment options for liver problems. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on your specific condition. Itâ€™s important to address any liver issues with a qualified professional. If you have specific information about your condition, I could help explain general concepts related to liver health. Happy Darting!
