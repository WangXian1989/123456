Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** These accounts allow you to defer taxes on your contributions until retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are more flexible, but youâ€™ll owe taxes on any dividends or capital gains realized. Use these accounts for investment strategies that favor long-term capital gains or for emergency funds.

3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals, like retirement, consider more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where growth can compound without immediate tax consequences.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider safer investments (bonds or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts where access to funds is easier.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund Consideration:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses and consider paying down high-interest debt as a priority.

5. **Diversification Among Accounts:**
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. This can reduce risk and volatility in your overall financial situation.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and financial goals. Rebalancing your investments can help maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized guidance, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help align your investments with your unique financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts while considering tax implications, investment horizons, and individual goals, you can optimize your savings for the future.
