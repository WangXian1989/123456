(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax considerations. Here are a few general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, as it may provide significant tax benefits depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you might then allocate excess funds to a taxable account. Keep in mind that the investments here will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating funds within these accounts as well. Generally, a balanced approach is advisable, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash according to your risk profile.

1. **First things first** â€“ If your 401(k) has an employer match, you better be throwing in enough dough to snag that sweet, free cash. Donâ€™t let that slip through your fingers!

2. **Next up: IRAs** â€“ Once youâ€™ve drained your employer of their freebie, shift your sights to an IRA. If you're under a certain income threshold, a Roth IRA could be goldâ€”tax-free growth for life, baby!

3. **Then, tackle that taxable account** â€“ Youâ€™ve maxed out the other two? Awesome! Now you can stash extra funds in a taxable account. Just know that Uncle Samâ€™s gonna want a slice when you sell.

4. **And remember asset allocation** â€“ Donâ€™t just throw random investments in there. Balance things out based on how much risk you can handle. Stocks might give you the biggest gains but can also be wild rides. Choose wisely!

Go get â€™em, champ! Happy investing!
