Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some key methods:

1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a relationship with the suspect can make them more willing to share information.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Encouraging suspects to talk freely can lead to more detailed responses without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights:**
   - **Informing Suspects:** Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney can safeguard against violations.
   - **Waiver of Rights:** If a suspect voluntarily waives their rights, they can provide information without coercion.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing:**
   - **Memory Recall Techniques:** This method encourages suspects to recall details without leading questions, helping them to provide their version of events naturally.
   - **Non-Confrontational Approach:** Keeping a calm and non-threatening demeanor can facilitate a more open dialogue.

By employing these techniques, law enforcement can effectively gather information while adhering to legal and ethical standards.
