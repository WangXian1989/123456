To determine the best allocation of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider several factors including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### Considerations for Distribution:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages on contributions, but capital gains may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income depending on the duration of your investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are generally for long-term retirement savings, while taxable accounts can be more flexible for short-term needs or goals.

### Recommended Strategy:

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
  - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your financial situation and tax preference.
  
- **Consider Targeting a Balanced Distribution**:
  - A common approach is to allocate a percentage of savings across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. For instance:
    - **40% in 401(k)** (if employer match is available)
    - **30% in IRA** (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation)
    - **30% in taxable accounts** for flexibility or investments you may need before retirement.

### Reassess Periodically:
- Review and adjust your allocation regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
