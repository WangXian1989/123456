When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach generally involves considering factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and the unique benefits of each account type. Here’s a structured way to think about it:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional) or after-tax (for Roth), which can affect your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be a traditional IRA, with similar tax advantages as a 401(k), or a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside of retirement accounts. Earnings are subject to capital gains and income tax.

### 2. Consider Your Investment Goals
- **Retirement**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you get matching contributions in your 401(k). The rule of thumb is to contribute enough to get any employer match as that is essentially “free money.”
- **Short-Term Goals**: Consider taxable accounts for cash you may need within a few years, since retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **Current Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) might be more beneficial since you can defer taxes. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts could be advantageous.
- **Withdrawals**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them appealing if you expect significant growth. Taxable accounts allow for more flexible withdrawals but with potential tax implications.

### 4. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- **401(k) Investment Choices**: Ensure a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Many plans offer target-date funds that automatically adjust based on your retirement date.
- **IRA Choices**: You have wider options in an IRA, such as individual stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, which can be tailored to your long-term strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs with lower turnover. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains if needed.

### Example Allocation:
- **Max out 401(k)** contribution up to employer match.
- **Max out IRA** contributions (preferably Roth if eligible) for tax-free growth.
- Use **remaining funds** for taxable accounts to fund short-term goals or for investment opportunities that require accessing cash more quickly.

### 5. Regular Reviews:
Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changing tax laws.

### Summary:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Maximize your IRA contributions.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term goals.
4. Diversify investments across all accounts based on tax efficiency and goals.

### Final Tip:
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation, ensuring that your investment choices align with your long-term financial objectives.

Happy investing!
