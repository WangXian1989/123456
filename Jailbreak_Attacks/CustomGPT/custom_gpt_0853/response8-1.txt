Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Use these for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider using this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the short term or for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments to benefit from compounding.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Costs and Fees**: Look at the fees associated with each account type and investment choice.

Before making decisions, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
