To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use a **Roth IRA** for accounts you expect to withdraw from in retirement, as they allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable accounts** can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate different assets across accounts. For example, keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while placing less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

4. **Monitor Fees and Expenses**:
   - Choose low-cost funds, especially in your 401(k) and IRA, to enhance your investment returns over time.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Tailor your contributions based on when you expect to need the money. Allocate more to retirement accounts if your goal is long-term, and consider more liquidity in safe, taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and rebalance to keep in line with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
