Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Prioritize contributions to your **401(k)** up to the employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for money needed within the next few years or to access funds without penalties.
   - You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your distribution and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### 6. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out the employer match + any additional contributions.
- **IRA:** Contribute fully to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any extra savings after maximum contributions.

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and accessibility based on your personal financial landscape.
