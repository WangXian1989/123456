Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use the 401(k) for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they are protected from capital gains taxes.
   - Use the taxable account for more conservative investments, or those you'll need access to before retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
