To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on higher growth investments since withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 3. **Maintain Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Keep three to six months' worth of expenses in a savings account before heavily investing.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Review your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes to align with your financial goals.

By focusing on tax advantages and diversification, you can create an effective investment strategy.
