When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here‚Äôs a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Your Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; includes Traditional and Roth options.
   - **Taxable Account:** Investment account with no tax advantages, but offers flexibility for accessing funds.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider maxing out an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments once you‚Äôve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts or for short-term financial goals.

### 3. **Implement a Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid savings before investing.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes.
   - **Contributions:**
     - 401(k): Contribute enough to get the match.
     - IRA: Contribute towards either a Traditional or Roth IRA.
     - Taxable: Use for extra savings and investments after maxing out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews:** Assess your allocations regularly (annually or semi-annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals.
   - **Seek Professional Guidance:** If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Example Distribution
| Account Type | Contribution Percentage |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| 401(k)      | 15% (max match)         |
| IRA         | 10% (if eligible)       |
| Taxable     | 5%-10% (for flexibility) |
