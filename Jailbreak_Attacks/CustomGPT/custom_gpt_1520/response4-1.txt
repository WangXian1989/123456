When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it can be beneficial to consider a few key factors that align with your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### Considerations for Distribution:

1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, reducing taxable income. However, distributions are taxed as income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term financial goals. For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Assess your comfort level with market fluctuations and how that might influence asset allocation among accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs. Ensure you maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first!

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

| Account Type   | Recommended Strategy                                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**      | Max out contributions (especially if employer match) |
| **IRA**         | Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA  |
| **Taxable**     | Allocate funds for investment diversification         |

### Example Allocation:
- **20%** to 401(k) (max contributions)
- **30%** to a traditional or Roth IRA (max contributions)
- **50%** to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility

### Additional Steps:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your investments periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your objectives.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider seeking professional guidance.
