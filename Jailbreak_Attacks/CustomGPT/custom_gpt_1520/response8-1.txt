When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, but withdrawals are tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, maxing out your Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - Consider contributing to your 401(k) if you're expecting to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts First**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA. After these, use additional savings for your taxable account.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversification across all accounts can reduce risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your comfort with potential fluctuations.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Keep track of your investments and make adjustments as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Plan
| Account Type     | Contribution % | Purpose                                         |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 50%            | Employer match + tax-deferred growth           |
| IRA              | 30%            | Tax benefits and flexibility                    |
| Taxable Account   | 20%            | Accessible funds for short-term goals or emergencies |
