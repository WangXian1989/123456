- **Regular Exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes a day of moderate exercise.
- **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can alleviate stress on the liver.

### 2. Medications
- Certain medications may be prescribed depending on the liver condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

### 3. Medical Procedures
- In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

### 4. Supplements and Herbal Remedies
- Some may find benefit in specific supplements (like milk thistle) but always consult a doctor before starting any new supplements.

### 5. Regular Monitoring
