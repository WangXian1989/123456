Investing and distributing funds among different account types, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match is typically recommended, as that is essentially free money. After reaching the match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your eligibility.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Recognize that distributions from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal. In contrast, tax on gains in a taxable account is typically lower due to capital gains tax rates. Consider holding investments that are likely to appreciate in value (and are thus more heavily taxed) in tax-advantaged accounts, while this can allow for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all account types while considering the investment time horizon for each account (short-term versus long-term). For example, equities (stocks) might be a better fit for long-term accounts (like IRAs) due to their potential for higher growth, whereas more stable assets (like bonds) could be held in taxable accounts to provide income.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment portfolio across all accounts. Changes in market conditions or personal circumstances (such as income changes or approaching retirement) may necessitate adjustments to your strategy.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategically consider the sequence of withdrawals from your accounts. Withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow, but it depends on your specific tax situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor a distribution strategy to your unique circumstances and goals.
