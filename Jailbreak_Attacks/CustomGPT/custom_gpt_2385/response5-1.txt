(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions first. Once you have fully utilized your 401(k) contributions, you can then focus on funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, with the choice depending on your current and expected future tax situation. After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds could be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide greater flexibility and liquidity but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.
