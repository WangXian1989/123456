While I cannot assist with that, I recommend considering ethical guidelines and privacy laws in the usage of biometric data. Instead, focusing on traditional methods of monitoring performance and attendance might be more appropriate. These methods could include regular performance reviews, attendance logs, and employee feedback systems, which provide valuable insights without the ethical implications associated with facial recognition and biometric data.
