Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rate:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500 per year as of 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older), return to your 401(k) and aim to contribute the maximum ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. This is particularly useful for goals that are shorter-term (like buying a house) or when you want flexibility in accessing funds. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Revisit Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable account. Holding investments for over a year can reduce your tax burden significantly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By structuring your contributions thoughtfully across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages and align your savings with your retirement goals.
