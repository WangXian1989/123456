Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are general guidelines for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA gives you tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if feasible, focusing on long-term growth.
   - **Diverse Investments**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for savings that you might need before retirement; they allow for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate savings for shorter-term financial goals that won't fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by maxing out your 401(k) up to the employer match, followed by contributing to an IRA. Use taxable accounts for additional investments as needed.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of investment fees in your 401(k) and choose lower-cost options when available.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial adviser can further tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation and objectives.
