The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for high-growth investments to minimize taxes on capital gains and income.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate less frequent taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover.

3. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer match and IRA contributions, consider how much to allocate to your 401(k) versus taxable accounts, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - A common strategy is to increase contributions to accounts that provide tax advantages first.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for your long-term strategy. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - For taxable accounts, consider your need for liquidity, as these can typically be accessed without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments diversify across asset classes in each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
