Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Keep in mind that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred like 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your income level, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes but offer more flexibility with withdrawals. They can be useful for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline:** The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, make sure you have enough in an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice based on your unique situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.
