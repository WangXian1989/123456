(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth in a 401(k) and potential tax-free withdrawals in a Roth IRA.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better choice, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are well diversified across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

1. **Snag That Free Money!**: First, pump enough into your 401(k) to grab any employer match. Treat it like a bonusâ€”free cash that you didnâ€™t have to hustle for!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Goldmine**: After that, hit up your IRA. If you can, go for a Roth IRA because who doesnâ€™t love tax-free growth? Just remember, if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, pay those taxes upfront and let the magic happen later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Your taxable accounts are like your emergency stash. They give you flexibility if you need to access cash before retirementâ€”you don't want to be penalized for early withdrawals.

4. **Aggressive Diversification**: Donâ€™t just toss your money all in one place. Spread it out! Go for a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts. Shake things up based on your risk appetite and life stage.

5. **Stay Agile**: Check-in on your investments regularly. Life changes, and so should your strategyâ€”donâ€™t be that person who sets it and forgets it!

Just remember, personal finance is personal. Tailor this advice to your situation and watch your wealth grow!
