To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for tax-deferred growth and any available employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments with high turnover or those expected to be held for a shorter period, as these can incur capital gains taxes.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Evaluate Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Match your investment choices to your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home) and when you plan to access these funds.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced allocation across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following this approach, you can optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
