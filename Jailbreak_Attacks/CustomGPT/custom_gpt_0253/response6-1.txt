To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial for higher current income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for compounding benefits.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re maximizing contributions to retirement accounts to take advantage of employer matches and tax deductions.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and achieve targeted asset allocation.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k)** (especially if employer match exists)
- Contribute to **IRA** (either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation)
- Allocate remaining funds to **Taxable Accounts** for flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocation annually to adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

This strategy provides a balanced approach to tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity.
