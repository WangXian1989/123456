To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Contributions:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Utilize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on maximizing your contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like your traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA) since they reduce your taxable income in the contribution year.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Also, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a proper asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Different accounts may have different investment strategies.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:** Review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment objectives.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, especially considering tax implications, to minimize your overall tax burden.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Finally, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your retirement accounts and taxable investment accounts.
