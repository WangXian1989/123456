The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deductible contributions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they are realized. However, they offer flexibility with no contribution limits and the ability to withdraw anytime without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all of your accounts. This helps manage risk.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, you may want to prioritize more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining a growth strategy in your taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund established outside of these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

6. **Plan for withdrawal strategy**: Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to deplete taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Balancing between these accounts effectively can maximize your growth potential while minimizing your tax liabilities over time. It's important to revisit your strategy regularly as your financial situation and tax laws can change.
