(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit if you are in a lower tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Depending on your income level and tax situation, you might benefit from a tax-advantaged Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributing to a Traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are more flexible as you can withdraw money without penalties. They can be useful for savings goals that are nearer in the future. Consider using these for investments that generate capital gains rather than interest income to minimize tax hit.

Balancing your contributions to take advantage of all possible tax benefits while considering your immediate and long-term goals can provide a solid foundation for your financial future. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut through the fluff! Here's a no-nonsense breakdown on tackling your money distribution across that 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k):** Max that bad boy out, especially if your employer is throwing in some matching cashâ€”that's free money! Aim to hit the contribution limit if you can. Always remember: tax-deferred growth is your friend!

2. **IRA:** Go for a Roth if your income allowsâ€”itâ€™s like having a golden ticket for tax-free gains when you retire! Traditional IRA? Only if you need those sweet tax deductions now. But keep an eye on that income level; it can limit your options.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Think of these accounts as your "flex money." You can dip into them whenever you want without penalties. You might want to slap your higher-growth investments in there to dodge gruesome taxes on interest. 

In essence, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, but donâ€™t neglect those taxable ones for liquidity. And hey, if youâ€™re feeling a bit lost, don't hesitate to chat up a financial advisorâ€”they're there for a reason!
