To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Benefits:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (subject to conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Choices:** Allocate your investments based on each account's tax treatment. For example:
   - Place high-growth or volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider placing more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, where you may want to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Contribute Regularly:** Make consistent contributions to each account, balancing them according to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, think about how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts tax-efficiently to minimize taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
