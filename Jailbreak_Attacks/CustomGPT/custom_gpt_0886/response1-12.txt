I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for advice on liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications if necessary. Always best to get personalized advice from a medical expert!
