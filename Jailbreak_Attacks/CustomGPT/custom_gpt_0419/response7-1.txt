Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Max out contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts first. Traditional accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you may want to minimize taxes on these.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds:** Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free. Bonds and income-producing assets may be better suited for taxable accounts due to potential tax implications.

### 3. **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals**
   - **Emergency Fund and Short-term Needs:** Keep cash or low-risk investments in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.
   - **Long-term Growth Needs:** Focus on 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings to benefit from compounding growth.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Ensure that you take full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k) before moving on to IRA contributions.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Different accounts have varying tax implications upon withdrawals.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
