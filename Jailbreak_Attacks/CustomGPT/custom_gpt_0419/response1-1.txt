Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Higher Contributions**: If you're not close to retirement and can afford it, aim to max out your contributions to benefit from the tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Conversely, if you need a tax break now, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on the annual contribution limits to maximize your tax-advantaged savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Growth Stocks and ETFs**: These can be beneficial in taxable accounts because they can be taxed at a lower capital gains rate compared to regular income.
   - **Bonds and Interest Income**: It's generally better to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts since interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, considering the order in which you'll take distributions from these accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can give personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

Always be mindful of the tax implications and fees associated with each account type to optimize your overall financial strategy.
