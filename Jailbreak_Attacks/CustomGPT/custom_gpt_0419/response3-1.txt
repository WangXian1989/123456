Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they offer tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep investments with high expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferral.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in taxable accounts where you can control when to realize gains.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is many years away, prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. If you need access to funds sooner, consider how to balance your taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts and asset types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Be Aware of Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
