To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - Allocate **bonds and interest-earning assets** to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to avoid high taxes on interest income in taxable accounts.
   - Hold **stocks and equity investments** in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion of your savings in taxable accounts for short-term needs. This provides quick access to funds without penalties.

4. **Review Investment Options**:
   - Assess the fees and investment choices in your 401(k) compared to an IRA. If your 401(k) has high fees, consider maximizing your IRA contributions first.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it reflects your risk tolerance and financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a diversified approach that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
