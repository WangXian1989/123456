Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax bracket, financial goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals, but they incur capital gains taxes on earnings. If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. This can help mitigate risk.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation, especially as markets fluctuate.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable accounts for unexpected expenses, ensuring you have liquidity.

6. **Long-Term Growth Focus**:
   - If you have a longer time horizon, consider higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRA for potential growth, leaving safer assets in taxable accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement can be beneficial for tax reasons, but this depends on your overall financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances and goals.
