When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies to optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if you’re comfortable with your employer's plan options and fees.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions depending on income levels.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like certain bonds or short-term holdings. They are also useful for saving for near-term goals since they offer more flexibility in withdrawals.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes, while holding stocks and index funds in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate your assets based on when you’ll need the funds. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while those needed in the short term should be more conservative.

6. **Adjust Based on Tax Circumstances**: Be mindful of your income range to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, and strategize withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impacts.

7. **Review and Rebalance Annually**: Periodically reassess your investment allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
