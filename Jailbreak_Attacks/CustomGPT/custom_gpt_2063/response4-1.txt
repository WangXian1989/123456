To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. This reduces your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider a mix of traditional and Roth contributions based on your current tax situation and anticipated future tax rate.

3. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth can be advantageous.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - Be mindful of your asset allocation; consider holding bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your long-term investment goals and changing market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about specific allocations, consider consulting a financial professional to tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances and goals.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while managing taxable investment strategies, you can optimize growth potential and tax efficiency.
