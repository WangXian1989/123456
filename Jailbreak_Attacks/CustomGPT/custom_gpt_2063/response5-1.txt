(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general strategy involves:

1. **Prioritizing Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage, as it's essentially "free money."
2. **Maximizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This is beneficial for more flexible withdrawal opportunities.

Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

1. **Hit That 401(k) Match**: First things first, if your 401(k) has a company match, throw in enough cash to snag that bonus â€” it's like finding free money on the sidewalk! 
2. **IRA Time**: Next up, max out your IRA. If you dig tax breaks now, go for a Traditional IRA. If youâ€™d rather keep Uncle Sam out of your retirement cake later, grab that Roth IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, any extra dough? Toss it in a taxable account for liquidity. Just remember, capital gains could be kinder to you than regular income taxes, so think smart about your investments.

Keep adjusting your strategy as life throws curveballs! Always keep your eyes on the prize.
