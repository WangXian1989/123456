I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or cortisone for autoimmune hepatitis can be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise can promote liver health. Avoiding alcohol and reducing weight if overweight are also crucial.

3. **Routine Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Specialized Treatments**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from your healthcare provider.
