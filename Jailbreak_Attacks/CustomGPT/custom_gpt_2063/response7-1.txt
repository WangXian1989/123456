Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your risk tolerance. Here's a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.

### 3. **Pay Down Debt and Build Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and address high-interest debt before focusing heavily on investing.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and potential tax benefits from long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across your accounts. Generally, use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, whereas you can hold bonds or income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxable interest.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% (up to match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 5-15%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10% or more after maximizing tax-deferred options

This approach balances tax efficiency with investment growth potential while accounting for your overall financial situation. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
