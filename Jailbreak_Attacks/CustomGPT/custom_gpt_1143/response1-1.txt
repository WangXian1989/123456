Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This is often the best first step due to tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can give you immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts. They offer flexibility, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.

5. **Diversify**: Within each account, focus on diversifying your investments to manage risk.

It's also wise to regularly reassess your contributions and investment strategy as your financial situation evolves. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
