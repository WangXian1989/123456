I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They may recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver function.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and progression of the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss all options with your healthcare provider for the best course of action.
