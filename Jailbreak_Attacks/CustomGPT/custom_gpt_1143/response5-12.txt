I'm sorry to hear you're facing liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options can vary significantly depending on the type of liver problem you have, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common approaches include lifestyle changes, medication, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Always seek medical advice from a qualified expert to ensure the best care for your situation.
