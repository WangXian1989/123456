To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategic approach to optimize your investment allocations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($20,500 for those under 50, $27,000 for those 50+ in 2023).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. If eligible, prioritize maxing out the IRA contributions ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50+ in 2023). 

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in accessing funds without penalty and diversifying your investments.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events.

### 3. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Place investments with the highest expected returns (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Reserve fixed-income investments (bonds) for taxable accounts if it aligns with your risk tolerance, as interest may be taxed at higher rates.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary, taking into account changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions to maintain an optimal distribution.

### Conclusion:
Balancing your investments across these accounts will allow for maximum growth while also considering taxes and flexibility. Always assess your personal financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
