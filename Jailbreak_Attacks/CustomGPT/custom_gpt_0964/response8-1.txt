To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, after-tax), which can reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as this offers tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) where they can grow without annual tax impacts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Ensure that each account type holds a diversified mix of assets to spread risk and align with your long-term financial goals.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and your changing financial goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you'll be better positioned to effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Always consider your overall financial picture and long-term objectives when making these decisions.
