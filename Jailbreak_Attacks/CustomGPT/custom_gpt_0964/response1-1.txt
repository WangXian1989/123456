Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you make the best decisions:

### 1. **Evaluate Contributions and Limitations**
   - **401(k):** Maximize your contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older) for 2023.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this account for additional savings or investments that exceed retirement account limits, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains tax on sales and consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Prioritize Debt Reduction**
   - If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritize paying it down before maximizing contributions, as this can yield a higher return than investments.

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 5. **Long-Term Strategy**
   - Ensure that each account aligns with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, anticipated expenses, and desired lifestyle.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations based on market performance, personal risk tolerance changes, or shifts in financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about allocations or strategies, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k) up to employer match (e.g., 6% of salary)**
- **Contribute up to the IRA limit (considering Roth vs. Traditional)**
- **Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account for flexibility and additional growth opportunities**

### Conclusion
Distributing money effectively among these accounts requires balancing short-term needs with long-term growth. By understanding the unique attributes of each account type and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your financial future.
