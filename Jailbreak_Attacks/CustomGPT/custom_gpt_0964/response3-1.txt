Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a structured approach you might consider:

### Step 1: Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Short-term Needs**: Consider how much you may need in the near future for expenses or emergencies.
- **Long-term Growth**: Identify the amount you want to save for retirement or other long-term goals.

### Step 2: Understand the Accounts
1. **401(k)**:
   - Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - Limited investment options depending on the plan.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).
   - Greater investment flexibility than a 401(k).
   - Contribution limits apply.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - No tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime without penalties.
   - Capital gains taxes apply on profits when you sell investments.
   - Useful for short-term goals or when you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Step 3: Develop a Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have capacity, contribute beyond the match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Step 4: Investment Allocation
- Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Step 5: Regular Review and Rebalance
- Annually review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion
The best distribution of your money across these accounts should align with your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term objectives. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your strategy further, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
