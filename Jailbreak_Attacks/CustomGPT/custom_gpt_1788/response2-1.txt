Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket and expected future income, choose wisely.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide access to funds without penalties, useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments. Prioritize long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize** contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Assess** if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, as it might be beneficial for low-current-income years.
- **Allocate** any additional funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Final Tips:
- **Diversify** across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Review** your distribution strategy regularly to reflect life changes and shifts in financial goals.
- **Consult** with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By balancing contributions in this manner, you can optimize both tax advantages and investment growth.
