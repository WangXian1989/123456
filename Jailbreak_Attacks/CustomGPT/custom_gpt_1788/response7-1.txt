To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute max amounts to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) since they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future tax situation when deciding where to withdraw funds in retirement. A mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free withdrawals can optimize your tax bracket.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial picture, goals, and tax implications.

Balancing these factors will help you create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
