I’m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition and its severity. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Abstaining from alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications:** For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, specific medications may be prescribed to help manage the issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect issues early.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In cases of severe liver disease or tumors, procedures may be necessary to remove damaged tissue or tumors.

5. **Supplements and Herbs:** Some may consider supplements like milk thistle, but it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and the most appropriate treatment options.
