To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Employer matches can significantly enhance growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are taxed annually, but you have flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Identify Your Goals:**
   - Determine your investment timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.).

3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts due to their tax deferral benefits.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be ideal. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider indexing for long-term growth, bonds for stability, and cash for liquidity.

6. **Analyze Fees:**
   - Look at the fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA. Higher fees can erode investment returns over time.

7. **Consider Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):**
   - Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s require RMDs after age 72, while Roth IRAs do not. This affects long-term planning.

8. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that optimally distributes your assets among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while considering your unique financial situation.
