Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), with potential tax-deductible contributions depending on your income and filing status.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, which can vary based on how long you hold investments.

3. **Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRAs to benefit from compounding without the tax burden in the interim.
   - If you foresee needing access to funds before retirement, consider allocating more towards your taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, higher-risk assets like stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments could be placed in taxable accounts to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes:** Regularly reevaluate your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, or tax laws.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
