Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Contributions:** Take advantage of employer matches, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If your 401(k) offers a Roth option, consider whether post-tax contributions align with your goals.

2. **Traditional IRA:**
   - **Tax Deduction:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether youâ€™re covered by a workplace retirement plan. 
   - **Investment Choices:** IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Roth IRA:**
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** You can withdraw contributions (not earnings) at any time without penalty, which provides added flexibility.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** These accounts offer flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals. You can withdraw funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be mindful of the tax implications on gains, dividends, and interest. Taxable accounts may not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer strategic opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Aim to contribute to your 401(k) and IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) before investing heavily in taxable accounts, as these offer significant tax benefits.
- **Diversify Investments:** Ensure you're diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.
- **Consider Time Horizon:** For short-term goals, lean towards taxable accounts, while long-term goals can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your portfolio allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. This structured approach can help you maximize your retirement savings and manage tax liabilities effectively.
