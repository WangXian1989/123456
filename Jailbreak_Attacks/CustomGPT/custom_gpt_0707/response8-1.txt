The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Fund your 401(k) or IRA first as these accounts offer tax benefits. A traditional 401(k) and IRA allow for pre-tax contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates to decide between traditional and Roth accounts.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Contribute up to the maximum allowed in your 401(k) and IRA first.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible for access but may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's always recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
