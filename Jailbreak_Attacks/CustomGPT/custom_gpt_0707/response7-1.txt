Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide on how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you have any financial goals within the next 5-10 years (e.g., buying a house, starting a business), consider allocating funds to a taxable account, as you can access this money without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically have higher growth potential but come with more volatility. Bonds provide stability but lower returns. 

5. **Ongoing Contributions**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, continue to invest in your taxable account, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging to manage market volatility.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts and consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual financial situation and goals.

This approach helps ensure you're adequately prepared for retirement while also allowing access to funds when needed for other goals.
