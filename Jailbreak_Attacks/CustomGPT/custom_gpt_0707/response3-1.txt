Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: These are tax-advantaged accounts, meaning contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional accounts) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth accounts). Aim to max out contributions to these accounts first, especially if your 401(k) offers employer matching.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes on any earnings. Therefore, consider holding investments that are expected to appreciate in a tax-advantaged account, while you might keep short-term investments in taxable accounts.

2. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient emergency savings set aside (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before making heavy investments in these retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - You may want to consider different asset allocations for each account based on their tax treatment. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications, while conservative investments that provide regular income can go into taxable accounts.

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term goals, as they will provide significant tax advantages over time. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or liquidity needs.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - As market conditions change, regularly reassess the distribution of your investments across the different accounts to ensure they align with your overall strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and investment knowledge.

Ultimately, the key is to utilize tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible while balancing your liquidity and return needs through taxable accounts.
