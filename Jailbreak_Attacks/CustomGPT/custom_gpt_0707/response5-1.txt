(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment time horizon, and personal preferences. Generally, itâ€™s advised to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility with managing your investments and withdrawals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.

After that, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re all about that future tax-free lifestyle, go the Roth route; otherwise, a traditional IRA is your jam for tax deductions now. Once youâ€™ve got those accounts humming along, itâ€™s taxable account time! You can throw in any extra cash there for that sweet liquidityâ€”just remember, the taxman will come for your gains. Balance is key; donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! And hey, if you're lost, hit up a financial advisor to get the skinny on your best game plan! ðŸ¤‘
