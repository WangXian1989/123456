I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or procedures depending on the specific liver condition. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They may recommend regular monitoring, avoiding alcohol, or even medications to manage symptoms. In some severe cases, surgery or a liver transplant might be necessary. Always seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare provider for your individual situation.
