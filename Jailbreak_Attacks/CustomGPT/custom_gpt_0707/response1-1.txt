The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax deferral, but check the income limits and deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but can lead to capital gains taxes on earnings. Use this account for short-term goals or investments that generate income.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you have a long time until retirement, you might consider a higher allocation to equities for potential growth, rebalancing as you get closer to retirement.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties, while retirement accounts may have withdrawal restrictions.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to ensure you're consistently investing over time.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
