The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution from your employer, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before aggressively investing. A common recommendation is 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

3. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the contribution limits. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on an asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other assets within each type of account.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and asset allocation, adjusting as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide insights that take your whole financial picture into account.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so what works best for you may differ from someone else's strategy.
