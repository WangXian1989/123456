The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and expected retirement needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially "free money" and a good return on investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. The tax advantages of IRAs can help your money grow more efficiently. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide an immediate tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, as you won't face early withdrawal penalties or required minimum distributions (RMDs) as with retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, ensure that you have a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For example, high-growth investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, while income-generating assets may be more appropriate for taxable accounts due to their tax treatment.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically revisit your investment strategy and asset distribution as your financial situation changes, tax laws evolve, or you approach retirement.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and ensure you're optimizing your investments and tax situation effectively.
