The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, income level, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across your accounts. For instance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your Roth accounts since withdrawals are tax-free, while more conservative investments could be placed in taxable accounts for easier access without penalty.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax bracket in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary.

6. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity Needs**:
   - Make sure you have an emergency fund in place, using your taxable accounts for any short-term liquidity needs, as accessing retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individualâ€™s situation is unique. A financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes your long-term financial health.
