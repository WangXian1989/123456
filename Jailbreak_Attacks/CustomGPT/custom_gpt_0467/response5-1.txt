(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for needing access to your funds. Generally, you may want to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, because they offer tax benefits like tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts).

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù After that, consider the investment options available and your own retirement timeline.
   
2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. This choice may depend on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
