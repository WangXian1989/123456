I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver treatment options. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Prescriptions to manage underlying conditions (like hepatitis).
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like a liver transplant might be considered.

Always check with a physician for appropriate guidance.
