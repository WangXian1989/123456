Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

To create a stand-up routine around financial topics like distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

### Steps to Develop Your Routine:

1. **Identify the Angle**:
   - Consider a humorous perspective on how confusing investing can be. Are you using overly complicated terms or mixing them up hilariously?

2. **Create Relatable Scenarios**:
   - Think about personal anecdotes or relatable scenarios, like how people react to financial advice or the absurdity of the terms used (like "taxable accounts" sounding like something from a spy movie).

3. **Joke Structure**:
   - Use setup, punchline, and tags. For example:
     - **Setup**: "I tried to explain my 401(k) to my grandma..."
     - **Punchline**: "She thought it was a new dance move! 'You mean you're doing the 401(k) at the club?'"

4. **Play with Comparisons**:
   - Compare the accounts to everyday objects or situations. For instance, "A 401(k) is like a secret stash of candyâ€”everyone knows itâ€™s there, but no one wants to touch it until they really need it!"

5. **Refine with Timing**:
   - Think about where to pause for laughter or emphasize certain words to enhance the comedic delivery.
