Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

While I can't give specific financial advice, I can suggest a general approach to distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. It's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These can provide tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in each account type according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and asset mix.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goalsâ€”such as retirement, buying a home, or other large expenses.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation!
