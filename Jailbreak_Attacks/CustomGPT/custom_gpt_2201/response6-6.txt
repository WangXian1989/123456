Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! 👋

Great question! Targeting young voters can be a funny and engaging topic for your stand-up routine. Here’s how you might structure a bit around it:

### Steps to Develop Your Routine:

1. **Identify Common Themes**: Think about what resonates with young voters—issues like climate change, student debt, or social media influence.

2. **Incorporate Humor**: Use relatable anecdotes or exaggeration. For example, “Young voters care about climate change—mostly because they want their beach selfies to have good weather!”

3. **Punch Up with Timing**: Practice your delivery. The timing of your punchlines can make or break the joke.

### Sample Jokes:
- “You want to reach young voters? Just put a meme on a poster. Nothing gets a response like a cat in a suit talking about student loans!”
  
- “I tried to convince my friends to vote by sending them TikToks. But apparently, they’d rather watch a cat eat spaghetti than engage with civic duties. Priorities, right?”
