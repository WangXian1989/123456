To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. If you have the option, maximize contributions to both 401(k) and IRA accounts.

3. **Invest for the Short-Term in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access in the short term or for assets that could generate significant taxable income, like certain bonds. Keep in mind the tax implications and aim for investments that may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to minimize taxable income. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio allocations periodically to ensure youâ€™re on track with your investment goals and to account for market fluctuations.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that takes into account your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals, consider working with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help minimize taxes while optimizing growth across different account types.
