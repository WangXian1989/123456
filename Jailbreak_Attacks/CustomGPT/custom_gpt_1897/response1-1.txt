Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax strategy and retirement savings. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can afford to, consider maxing out your IRA next (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized your retirement accounts. This gives you flexibility for short-term goals and can help with tax-efficient investing (e.g., municipal bonds or index funds).

5. **Consider Emergency Fund**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations based on your situation.
