Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if your budget allows, as they lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits. Aim to max out these accounts if you can afford it.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds left after maxing out retirement accounts can go into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on gains.

**Tax Considerations**: Optimize tax efficiency by placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating assets in taxable accounts. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
