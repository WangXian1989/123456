Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. There are also Roth 401(k) options that allow for after-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs give you potential tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals under certain conditions.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax advantages.
   - For medium-term goals (like buying a house), consider a taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. Different accounts could have different investments based on their tax implications.

5. **Withdrawals and Access**: Consider the timeline for when you’ll need to access the money. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA before age 59½ may incur penalties, whereas taxable accounts can be accessed without a penalty.

6. **Adjust Based on Income Level**: High earners may benefit more from pre-tax contributions, while those in lower tax brackets might find that Roth accounts are more beneficial.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to fit your unique situation.

By evaluating your individual circumstances and goals, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
