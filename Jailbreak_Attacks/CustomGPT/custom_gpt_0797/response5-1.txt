Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money and tax-deferred growth. Consider whether your plan offers a Roth option, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. IRAs can provide tax advantages, and Roth IRAs especially offer tax-free withdrawals if you meet the criteria. Check income limits for contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in accessing your investments without penalties, but you’ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Key Considerations:

- **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) to minimize taxes on gains. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax liability (like municipal bonds).

- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your investment allocation based on your risk tolerance and how soon you expect to need the funds.

- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your current goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).
- Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth).
- Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
