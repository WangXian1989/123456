Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### Contributions
1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
2. **Max Out IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. These accounts often have favorable tax treatment.

### Investment Choices
1. **401(k)**: If your 401(k) offers good investment options with low fees, consider this a solid long-term investment vehicle. Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
2. **IRA**: IRAs often provide more flexibility in investment choices, including individual stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Consider using this account for growth-oriented investments, especially if you're young.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for any additional savings beyond retirement accounts. It's beneficial for short-term goals due to easier access to your funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Tax Considerations
1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term savings since they grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
2. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### Withdrawal Strategy
1. **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering the tax implications. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to allow tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to continue growing.

### Regular Review
Review your asset allocation regularly based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Professional Advice
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

By considering these factors and establishing a balanced approach, you can effectively distribute your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
