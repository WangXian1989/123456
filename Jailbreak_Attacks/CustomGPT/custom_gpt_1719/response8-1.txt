When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available), as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. You might allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts if you plan to access them earlier, while keeping more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from taxable accounts generally incur capital gains taxes, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as regular income. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets to strategically withdraw funds from each account.

5. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**: Maintain enough liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs before fully allocating your funds to retirement accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, investment performance, or life circumstances.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation and long-term goals.
