To optimize your investment strategy for retirement, it's essential to consider various factors such as your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax implications. Here are some guidelines to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Your Income Level**: Higher-income individuals might benefit more from traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax deductions. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**: If you have a long investment horizon, you might choose to take advantage of growth-oriented investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Holding a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, REITs) can help manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals. Be strategic about withdrawals in retirement to manage your tax liabilities efficiently.

**Summary**:
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, particularly focusing on employer matches.
- Consider your tax brackets and investment time frame when deciding asset allocations.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies specific to your situation and ensure regulatory compliance.
