When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach should consider your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the maximum match. This helps you benefit from "free" money. After that, consider maxing out your contribution to the 401(k) up to the annual limit if you can afford it, as it allows for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, you might opt for a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). If you prefer tax flexibility during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible. Aim to max out this account as well since it also offers tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement account contributions, consider funding taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility for mid-term goals, but keep in mind that capital gains taxes will apply to any profits when you sell investments. They are also useful for investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across asset classes and not overly concentrated in one area. This reduces risk and can enhance returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in the market and your personal financial situation. This might involve adjusting the percentages allocated to each type of account.

Ideally, consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies that suit your unique circumstances and goals.
