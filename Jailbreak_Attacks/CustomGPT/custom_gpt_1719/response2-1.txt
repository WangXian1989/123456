When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation) before putting additional funds into your 401(k).

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) versus your IRA. If your 401(k) has limited options or higher fees, you might prefer to direct more funds into your IRA.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to be more tax-efficient. Consider holding more income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment goals rather than by account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for short-term needs, while retirement accounts typically have tax implications for withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

This allocation strategy can help optimize your savings and investments over time while considering both short-term and long-term financial goals.
