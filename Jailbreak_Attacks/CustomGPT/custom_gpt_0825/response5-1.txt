(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Next, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax advantages. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

Review your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating funds. Diversifying your investments across these accounts while being mindful of the tax implications can help optimize your returns.

Go for the max contribution! After that, hit up your IRA. Roth IRAs are golden if you can swing it since your money grows tax-free and you wonâ€™t owe taxes when you withdraw it in retirement. 

Then, look at taxable accounts for that sweet flexibility. You can access your cash anytime without penalties. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxes. Mix it up based on your risk vibes and life goals, and remember: diversify like itâ€™s a partyâ€”spread your investments out so donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket!
