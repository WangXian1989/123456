The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also pre-tax, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, and interest or dividends are taxed in the year earned.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) since they can benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher capital gains or interest income, which could be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you maintain adequate liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies, so you donâ€™t have to withdraw from your 401(k) or IRA early, incurring potential penalties.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments may need to be. As you approach retirement, consider shifting more funds into safer investments to preserve your capital.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your investment allocations and adjust them based on performance and changing financial circumstances.
