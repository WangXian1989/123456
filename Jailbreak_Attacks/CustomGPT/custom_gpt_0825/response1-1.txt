To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Take full advantage of employer match contributions if available. Max out contributions if your budget allows, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as this account offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level. Prioritize this after maximizing the 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts provide flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals. Focus on investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Allocation Tips:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investments based on your risk appetiteâ€”more aggressive in retirement accounts and perhaps more conservative in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:** Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. Use retirement accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for short-term or upcoming expenses.

### Review Regularly:
Revisit your allocation periodically, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
