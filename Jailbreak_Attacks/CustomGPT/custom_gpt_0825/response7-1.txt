To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Employer matching contributions can enhance growth. Focus on maximizing these contributions if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose the type based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments. Capital gains taxes apply to profits, but you can offset losses.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by maxing out any employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), considering income limits and tax implications.
   - Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts for investment flexibility.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider holds in tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and account balances. Rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments and prioritizing contributions, you can create a balanced approach to maximize your long-term growth potential.
