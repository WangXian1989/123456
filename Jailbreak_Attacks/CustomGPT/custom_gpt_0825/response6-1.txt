Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, retirement goals, and investment growth potential. Hereâ€™s a strategy to balance your investments:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older. The IRA limit is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up.
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to earn any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Diversify Contributions
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in these accounts due to their tax shields. Consider a mix of equity mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds that align with your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more conservative investments or to hold tax-efficient assets like municipal bonds or index funds with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Regular Review and Adjust
- **Rebalance Annually**: Monitor your allocations regularly and adjust to align with changing market conditions and personal financial situations.
- **Age-Based Adjustments**: As you approach retirement, gradually reduce risk exposure by increasing bond holdings and fixed-income securities across all accounts.

This strategy aims to enhance your long-term financial security while optimizing tax efficiency.
