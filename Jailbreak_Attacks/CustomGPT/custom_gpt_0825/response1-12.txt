I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, alcohol avoidance, weight management, and regular exercise. Medications might be prescribed depending on the specific condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis. In severe cases, more invasive treatments, including surgery or liver transplantation, may be considered. Always best to follow medical guidance!
