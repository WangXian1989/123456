Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pretax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxation on capital gains, such as ETFs and index funds, or for funds needed in the short term.

4. **Review Your Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts, keeping in mind the specific tax implications of each type of account. For instance, you might want to hold bonds in a tax-advantaged account (to avoid higher taxes on interest income) and stocks in a taxable account.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Reassess your strategy periodically or when significant life events occur (e.g., marriage, job change, or market fluctuations).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your overall investment strategy, providing both growth potential and tax efficiency.
