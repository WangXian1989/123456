The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and, if applicable, contributing to a Roth IRA, return to your 401(k). Utilize tax-deferred growth, especially if you have a traditional 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investment options, particularly for money that you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified in terms of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

It might also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
