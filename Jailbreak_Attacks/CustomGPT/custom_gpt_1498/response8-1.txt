The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for more flexible investment options and withdrawals. These accounts are ideal for short-term savings or investments that generate capital gains, as you can utilize strategies to minimize taxes on gains and dividends.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily in any accounts. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
