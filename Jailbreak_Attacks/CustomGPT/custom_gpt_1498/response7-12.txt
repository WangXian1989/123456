I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. A doctor might also recommend regular monitoring to track any progression of the disease.

Always prioritize professional medical advice for health issues.
