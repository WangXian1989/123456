(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. A general approach might include maximizing contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) to take advantage of matching contributions, then contributing to an IRA for its potential tax benefits. Finally, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
