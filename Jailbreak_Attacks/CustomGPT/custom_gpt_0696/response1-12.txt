I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can offer the best advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type of liver problem you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in more serious cases, possibly procedures or surgery. Please reach out to a doctor to get personalized guidance and support! Your health is important! ðŸ˜Š
