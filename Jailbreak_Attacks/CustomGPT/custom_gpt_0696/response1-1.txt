Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it’s often wise to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals), you'll need to consider how taxes play into your current and future circumstances.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxable each year on dividends and capital gains. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with a tax hit.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate account before aggressively investing.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you're young and have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize Roth IRAs or stocks in a taxable account to take advantage of compounding growth with favorable capital gains tax rates. If you're closer to retirement, focus on maintaining a more conservative balance.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and account for different tax treatments.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

It's also a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. They can help you create a plan that considers both current and future financial needs.
