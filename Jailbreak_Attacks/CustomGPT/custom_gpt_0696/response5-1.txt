(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and your individual risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of that matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Pre-Tax Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to the traditional IRA (if eligible) or increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider a Roth Account**: If your income allows, contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) can be beneficial, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have contributed to your retirement accounts, you may want to consider a taxable account for additional investing. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals if needed before retirement.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) Match**: First up, if your employer is throwing in some cash for your 401(k) contributionsâ€”scoop that up! Free money is like the cherry on top of your financial sundae. 

2. **Tax Strategy**: Load up on your pre-tax funds like a traditional IRA or just crank that 401(k) up to 11! This is golden especially if you think youâ€™ll be chillinâ€™ in a lower tax bracket when you retire. 

3. **Roth Action**: If youâ€™ve got the room, get some of that tax-free goodness with a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Who doesnâ€™t want tax-free dough when they retire? Heck yeah!
