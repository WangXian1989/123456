When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits than IRAs. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible with no contribution limits, but investments are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is basically free money.
   - **Fund Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider maximizing your Roth IRA contributions next for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Continue with 401(k):** After maxing out the Roth IRA, contribute additional funds to your 401(k).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Finally, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts for greater withdrawal flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Determine your risk tolerance and allocate investments accordingly across all accounts to enhance diversification.
   - **Investment Choices:** Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regular Reevaluation**
   - **Check Contributions Annually:** Adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
   - **Rebalance Portfolio:** Regularly assess your investment mix to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your asset distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency. Would you like detailed examples or further clarification on any of these points?
