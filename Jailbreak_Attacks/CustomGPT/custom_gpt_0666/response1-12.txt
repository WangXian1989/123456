I'm not a doctor, but if you suspect liver issues, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options can vary based on the specific liver problem but might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight management, and cutting out alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis), antiviral drugs may be necessary.
3. **Monitoring & Management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and manage symptoms.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors, surgery may be considered.
5. **Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant might be needed.

Always seek advice from a medical professional for the best plan tailored to your needs.
