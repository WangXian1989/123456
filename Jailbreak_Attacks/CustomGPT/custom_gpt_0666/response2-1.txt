Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Think of this for long-term growth.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Diversify Accounts**: Aim for a mix between tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility in retirement regarding tax liability.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion of your savings in a taxable account for liquidity, in case of emergencies. 

5. **Age and Retirement Planning**: Younger investors may prioritize growth and thus lean more toward stock-heavy investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As retirement approaches, consider more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help minimize taxes on your tax-advantaged accounts, which can continue to grow.

7. **Annual Contributions**: If you have the capacity, maximize contributions annually to all accounts up to the limit set by the IRS.

8. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio according to market conditions and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
