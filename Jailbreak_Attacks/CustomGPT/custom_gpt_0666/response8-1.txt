To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize your employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, this can be beneficial.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, helpful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains distributions.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts rather than taxable accounts due to their higher tax implications.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
