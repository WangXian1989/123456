Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth might be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals later, beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where shorter-term capital gains could be taxed.

5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts to maintain a disciplined savings approach.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance and personal financial changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor your strategy better to your unique situation.

Balancing these accounts is about optimizing tax efficiency and aligning with your financial goals.
