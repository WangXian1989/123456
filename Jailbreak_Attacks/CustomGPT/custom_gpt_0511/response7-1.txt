To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Many employers offer matching contributions; aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if over 50). Depending on your income, some contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA).

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer matches, then contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth based on your eligibility).
   - If you reach these limits, consider contributing to your taxable account.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) could be beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, investing in a Roth IRA may be preferable.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Keep an Eye on Fees:**
   - Choose low-cost investment options within your 401(k) and IRA to maximize growth.

6. **Review Annually:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to meet your retirement goals.

Each individualâ€™s financial situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
