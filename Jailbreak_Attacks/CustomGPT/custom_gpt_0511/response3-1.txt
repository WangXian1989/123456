Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with pre-tax contributions (or post-tax with a Roth option). Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Standard investment accounts with no tax advantages but more flexibility in withdrawals and investment options.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first if possible. The 2024 contribution limits are approximately:
     - 401(k): $23,000 ($30,500 if age 50+).
     - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investing: 
     - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for higher-growth investments to maximize tax benefits.
     - Consider putting tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in diversified funds offered by your plan. Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Customize your investments further by choosing from a broader range of funds and assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider your income tax bracket. You might want to keep cash or bond investments here, as they typically generate interest subject to income tax.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Make sure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Age 30-40**: Prioritize maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions. Focus on stock-heavy investments within these accounts.
- **Age 40-60**: Continue prioritizing retirement accounts, but start diversifying more in taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Age 60+**: Shift to more conservative investments as you approach retirement, balancing withdrawal rates with longevity of savings.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning based on your unique situation.
