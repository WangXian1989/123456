To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Deferral Benefits**: Contributions to a 401(k) are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), allowing for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose the Right Type**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age. They offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider placing investments with lower turnover (like index funds) and tax-efficient assets in this account to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.
   - **Balance Growth and Stability**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance is essential.
   - **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals. Adjust contributions as needed.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, considering the order of withdrawals (taxable, then tax-deferred, then tax-free accounts).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your overall financial picture and goals.
