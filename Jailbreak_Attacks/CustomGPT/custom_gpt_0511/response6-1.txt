Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Benefits**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that may be needed in the short term since they don’t have tax advantages but provide liquidity.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Favor 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth where you defer taxes until retirement.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategies
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments in line with your risk tolerance across accounts. Consider stock-heavy investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- **Bond Investments**: If you're nearing retirement, consider holding bonds or fixed income in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. Rebalance Periodically
- **Allocation Adjustment**: Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to stay aligned with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution will vary based on your individual situation. It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs. Would you like help with a more detailed plan or analysis?
