Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: After getting the employer match, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) and IRAs or if you're looking for more flexibility or liquidity, consider taxable accounts. These can be useful for goals that are shorter-term than retirement.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, since capital gains and dividends are taxed.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation. Would you like more detailed information on any specific type of account?
