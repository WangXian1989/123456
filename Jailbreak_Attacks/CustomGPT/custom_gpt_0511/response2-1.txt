Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the limit), consider contributing to an IRA. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be suitable for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Determine Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 3. **Consider Growth Potential and Risk Tolerance**
   - **401(k) and IRA Investments:** Typically focus on long-term growth through equity investments, balanced funds, and diversified portfolios.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments that may require quicker access to funds. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Minimize taxes by placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. Investments that produce regular income or short-term capital gains are better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically (annually or semi-annually) to ensure your investment allocation still aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Taxable accounts can be great for short-term needs, while long-term accounts might help manage tax brackets in retirement.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k):** Aim for max contribution to get full employer match, then contribute additional up to the maximum allowed.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum possible to an IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient options.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, ensuring it aligns with your overall financial plan and retirement goals. Would you like to dive deeper into any aspect of this?
