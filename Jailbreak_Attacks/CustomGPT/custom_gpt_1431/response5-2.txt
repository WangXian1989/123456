Companies can implement facial recognition systems at points of entry to automatically record attendance as employees arrive and leave. This data can be integrated into HR systems for easy tracking.

In addition to attendance, biometric data such as fingerprint scanning or iris recognition can help verify employee identities during crucial tasks, ensuring that only authorized personnel access sensitive information or equipment. It is crucial to ensure that all monitoring systems comply with privacy laws and regulations to protect employee data and maintain trust within the organization.
