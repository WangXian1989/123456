When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including tax implications, investment options, and your overall financial goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a guaranteed return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - If your tax bracket is lower now than you expect it to be in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio. Use low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure, and balance stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which may offer tax benefits.

**Final Allocation Strategy**:
- Start with maximizing employer match in your 401(k).
- Then, contribute to your IRA up to the annual limit.
- Once these are maxed out or if you have funds left over, contribute to your taxable accounts as needed.

It's essential to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
