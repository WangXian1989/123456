The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Considerations**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans have higher annual contribution limits compared to IRAs, which can help you save more on a tax-deferred basis.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial as it allows for tax-deferred growth. A Roth IRA can be preferable if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which may affect how much you can invest.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide the most flexibility for withdrawals, often without penalties. They're ideal for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

4. **Balance and Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating your assets among these accounts. For example, you might keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your investments to ensure that they align with your financial goals, adjusting as necessary.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your unique circumstances.

In summary, a balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to secure any employer match, then prioritizing IRA contributions, and finally funding taxable accounts, all while considering your overall investment strategy and tax implications.
