Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short-term goals or for funds you might need before retirement. They are subject to capital gains tax, so itâ€™s wise to hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified to spread risk. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Priority**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

### 5. **Review Asset Location**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Revisit your allocations periodically (annually or semi-annually) to ensure they still align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, seeking advice from a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By using these strategies, you can create a well-balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
