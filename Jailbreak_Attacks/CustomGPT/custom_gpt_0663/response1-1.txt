Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces taxable income now, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages—either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Choose based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside of retirement accounts. Taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest. Flexible but less tax-efficient compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. Contribution Priorities

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After reaching the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If possible, maximize contributions to your 401(k) after contributing to your IRA, up to the annual limit (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 for those 50+).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out your retirement accounts. These are great for short-term goals since they offer more flexibility.

### 3. Asset Allocation

- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a growth-oriented investment strategy, especially if retirement is many years away. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax impact. For stocks held longer than a year, you’ll benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 4. Revisit Regularly

- Periodically assess your investment allocations and re-balance if your asset allocation drifts due to market movements.

### 5. Consult with a Financial Advisor

- Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize tax advantages and build a robust retirement portfolio.
