I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best approach depends on the specific liver problem you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier lifestyle is often the first step. This includes:
   - Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing sugar and fat intake.
   - Regular exercise to help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition:
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Immunosuppressants or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to control symptoms or complications, like diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Supplements**: Some individuals may benefit from supplements such as milk thistle, although it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

4. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging can help manage the condition effectively.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as advanced cirrhosis or liver cancer, surgical interventions like liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's crucial to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional who can provide tailored recommendations based on your medical history and current health status.
