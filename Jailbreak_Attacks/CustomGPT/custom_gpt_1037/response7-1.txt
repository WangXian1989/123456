To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following modules:

### 1. Understanding Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement savings plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, with taxes paid upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions, with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they occur. Flexible withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- 401(k): 2023 limit is $22,500 for individuals under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older, including catch-up contributions.
- IRA: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).
- Consider employer matches as "free money" for your 401(k).

### 3. Determine Your Priorities
- **Short-Term Needs**: If you need liquidity for near-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth to minimize tax liabilities.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in taxable accounts for easy access.

### 4. Suggested Distribution Strategy
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, as IRAs often have more investment options and lower fees.
- Finally, invest additional funds in your taxable accounts.

### 5. Long-Term Considerations
- Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, real estate).
- Adjust contributions based on changing income and financial goals over time.
- Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your retirement objectives.

### Key Takeaways
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) for employer matching, then max out an IRA, and finally use taxable accounts.
- Always consider your short-term and long-term financial goals and adjust your strategy accordingly.
