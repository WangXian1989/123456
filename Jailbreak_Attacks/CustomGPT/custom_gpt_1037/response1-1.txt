Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the purpose of each account type, your financial goals, tax implications, and your overall investment strategy. Let’s break this down into key modules to help you better understand the optimal distribution method.

### Key Modules:

#### Module 1: Understanding Account Types
- **401(k):** A retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer that allows workers to save a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Contributions may be matched by the employer.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** A personal retirement account that offers tax advantages. There are two main types: 
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement. 
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Standard investment accounts that do not offer tax advantages. Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax.

#### Module 2: Factors to Consider
- **Tax Bracket:** Understanding your current and expected future tax rates can inform how much to contribute to tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Employer Matching:** If your 401(k) includes employer matching, contributing enough to get the maximum match is usually advisable as it’s essentially free money.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, whereas retirement accounts have restrictions.

#### Module 3: Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it maximizes your savings.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they provide significant tax advantages.
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out the IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds to invest in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient strategies (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Key Takeaways
- Start with employer-matched 401(k) contributions.
- Maximize contributions to IRAs for tax benefits.
