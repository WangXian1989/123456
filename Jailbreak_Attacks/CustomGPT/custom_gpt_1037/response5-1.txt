(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking for tax deductions now, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or interest income, which can be taxed more heavily.

4. **Long-term Strategy**: Allocate your long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Annually**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and adjusts for changes in income or expenses.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best way to allocate your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on what youâ€™re looking to achieve and your risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach:

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: First off, if your employer offers a match, throw as much as you can into that sweet 401(k) to snag every dollar they're willing to contributeâ€”it's literally free money, folks!

2. **Hit the IRA Next**: Once the 401(k) is rocking and rolling with a match, focus on an IRA. A Roth IRA is a killer choice if you expect your income to rise. You get to enjoy tax-free growth down the road. But if you want those sweet tax deductions now, then a traditional IRA might be your jam. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might cash in sooner or if you want more control over when you recognize gains. Theyâ€™re great for building an emergency fund or funding a big purchase. Just watch out for those taxes!

4. **Stay Flexible and Review**: Keep an eye on your investments and adjust as your situation changes, like if you get a raise, have a kid, or decide to buy a yacht. (Just kidding about the yacht... maybe).

5. **Consult a Pro if Needed**: If youâ€™re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, sports fans, bring in a financial advisor. They can help tailor a plan that fits snugly with your personal finances.
