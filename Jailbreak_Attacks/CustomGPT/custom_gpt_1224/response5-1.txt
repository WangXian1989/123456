(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This might include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, focusing on investments that are more tax-efficient.
4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

1. **401(k) Hustle**: First off, if your employer offers a match, throw down enough to snag thatâ€”like picking up easy wins at a carnival. Thatâ€™s free loot!
2. **IRA Sweet Spot**: Next, hit up that IRA! Decide between Traditional and Roth based on whether you want to dodge taxes now or flip the script later. Just make sure youâ€™re chipping in the max.
3. **Taxable Playground**: Once those tax-advantaged accounts are pumping, dip your toes into taxable accounts. Here, go for index funds or ETFsâ€”they're like the cool kids at the investment party, low on taxes and high on returns.
4. **Mix It Up**: Lastly, donâ€™t just dump everything in one place! Spread your investments like butter on toastâ€”stocks, bonds, whatever floats your boat, based on your risk level. 

In the end, strategy is keyâ€”stay flexible and adjust as life throws curveballs!
