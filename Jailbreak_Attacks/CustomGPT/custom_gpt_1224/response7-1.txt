Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income, a traditional or Roth IRA can provide advantageous tax treatment.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is great for younger individuals or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, and interest and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Focus on higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Assets:** Consider placing bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before making larger contributions.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** If your primary goal is retirement, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-term Goals:** For shorter investment horizons, use taxable accounts for accessibility.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

By tailoring your distribution strategy to your financial situation and goals, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize tax liabilities.
