I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to get tailored advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications can help manage symptoms and treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

4. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding harmful substances.

5. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan.
