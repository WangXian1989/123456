The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - Take full advantage of employer matching contributions, if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to meet the match, then assess if you can contribute more, up to the annual limit.
   - 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, making them a good option for higher savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):**
   - Consider using a Traditional IRA if you want to lower your taxable income now and benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - The contribution limits for IRAs are lower than for 401(k)s, so after maximizing your 401(k) employer match, it's often a good idea to contribute to an IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These are best for funds you may need access to before retirement age since withdrawals are not subject to penalties.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Taxable accounts can also be beneficial for managing taxes in retirement, as you can strategically withdraw funds to minimize your tax burden.

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to any employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
- Any additional savings can then be allocated to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

**Review and Adjust:** 
- Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on their respective tax advantages and your withdrawal needs, you can create a more effective long-term investment strategy.
