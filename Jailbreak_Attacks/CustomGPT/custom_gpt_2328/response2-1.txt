When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to think about several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. This is beneficial for higher earners or those looking to lower their current tax burden.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties or restrictions. They can be a good place for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure that your investments across these accounts are well-diversified. Keep in mind that you don’t want to over-concentrate your assets in one type of account, leading to inefficient tax implications.

4. **Asset Location:** Consider the type of investments you are placing in each account:
   - Place high-growth, high-return investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to maximize tax deferral.
   - Place lower-growth investments that may produce taxable income (like bonds) in taxable accounts to avoid higher tax rates when held in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies:** Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Balancing distributions strategically among your accounts can help manage taxes in the future. 

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Economic conditions and your personal goals will change over time. Regularly review your investments and distribution strategy to ensure they still align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If in doubt, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your savings for both current and future needs.
