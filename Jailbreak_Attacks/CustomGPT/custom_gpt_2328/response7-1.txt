To create an effective investment strategy that optimally distributes your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key points:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each type of account has different annual contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) allows you to contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA has a contribution limit of $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older). Ensure you’re maximizing your contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts first.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA typically provide a tax deduction, lowering your taxable income for the year. ROTH IRA contributions are made after-tax, meaning qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Balancing your contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets can help you maximize your tax efficiency.

3. **Investment Goals**: Your individual goals, timelines, and risk tolerance should guide your allocation. If you are closer to retirement, you might want a more conservative mix in your tax-advantaged accounts, while younger investors may prefer a growth-oriented approach in their 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. You might choose to have equity exposure in your 401(k) and bonds in your IRA to balance risks. 

5. **Fees and Expenses**: Take into account the fees associated with each account. 401(k) plans can have varying fees, and higher expense ratios can eat into your returns. Consider investing in lower-cost index funds where possible.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may be more flexible for early withdrawals without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA accounts have specific rules about withdrawals.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so it's wise to review and adjust your portfolio allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also be helpful in creating a personalized plan based on your individual circumstances.
