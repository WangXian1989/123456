It’s great that you’re thinking about the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it’s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available) since that’s essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth) because they provide tax benefits that can grow your investment over time.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**: Think about what you want to achieve with your investments. If you have long-term goals like retirement, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts. If you're planning for shorter-term goals, more access to cash may be beneficial, which points towards taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: The type of account you should prioritize can depend on your current tax situation. If you’re in a lower tax bracket now compared to where you expect to be in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a good choice since you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later. If you believe your taxes will decrease or stay the same, a traditional IRA might be better.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering factors like age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. This will help mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.

5. **Maintain Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**: Having some funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawal without penalties, making it easier to handle unexpected expenses or opportunities.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your allocation across accounts based on changes in income, tax laws, or investment performance. 

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your situation, as they can provide personalized insights. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area?
