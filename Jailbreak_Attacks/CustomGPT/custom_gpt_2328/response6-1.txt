When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions and higher contribution limits. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax advantages, either on contributions (traditional IRA) or withdrawals (Roth IRA). Limitations exist on contribution amounts based on income and other factors.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** There are no contribution limits or tax advantages, but you will owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline:**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity without penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Focus more on retirement accounts, especially if you have time until retirement. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if your employer matches) and IRA for tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income now, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Use Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Fully Fund IRAs:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRAs for tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, especially if you plan on needing access to cash before retirement.

### Final Thoughts:
- Revisit and adjust your allocation annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial circumstances and goals.

By strategically balancing the benefits of each account type, you can optimize your investment growth while effectively managing your tax liability.
