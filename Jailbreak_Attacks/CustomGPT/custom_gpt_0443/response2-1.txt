To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. High contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA) upon qualified withdrawals. Lower contribution limits compared to 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds), which could be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Savings for retirement: Prioritize maxing out retirement accounts, particularly if you're younger and can benefit from compounding.
   - Short-term goals: Allocate funds to your taxable account for liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Re-evaluate your allocation periodically based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize your tax situation while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
