When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. The 401(k) may offer tax deferrals, while IRAs (Traditional and Roth) provide tax advantages either on the contributions or withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investment mix is diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For example, withdrawals from a traditional IRA and 401(k) are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate fund for emergencies, typically kept in your taxable accounts, to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals, including retirement age and desired lifestyle.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio as needed to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
