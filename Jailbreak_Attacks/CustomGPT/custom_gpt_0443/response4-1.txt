Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits before investing in a taxable account. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax and potentially higher taxes on dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess your investment distribution and rebalance if any account grows disproportionately due to differing performance.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings before locking money away in retirement accounts. 

7. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the right mix will depend on your circumstances, so consider your short-term needs and long-term goals when deciding how to allocate your finances.
