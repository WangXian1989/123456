It's important to approach the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it's beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments due to tax deferments or deductions. Allocate higher growth investments (like stocks) in these accounts since they won't be taxed until withdrawal.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Make sure you maximize contributions to employer-sponsored accounts like a 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution, since this is essentially “free money.” After meeting that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or REITs) to avoid higher taxes on those gains in tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts can also be beneficial for accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals thoughtfully to minimize tax implications. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage your taxable income levels and delay distributions from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across each account to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the different tax implications of each account type.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
