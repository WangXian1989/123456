Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize your taxable income. Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment allocations are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts can provide access to funds without penalties, which can be crucial for emergency situations.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy considering your specific situation can provide the most benefit.

Adjust your contributions as your financial situation evolves and always consider consult a tax professional for personalized advice.
