The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current age, retirement goals, tax situation, and overall financial strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility, as there are no penalties for withdrawal like there are with retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Typically, younger savers might have a more aggressive allocation (more stocks), while those nearing retirement may shift to a more conservative allocation (more bonds).

5. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can minimize your tax liability.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
