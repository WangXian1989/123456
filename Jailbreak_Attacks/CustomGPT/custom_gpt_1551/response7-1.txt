Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a guideline on how to approach this:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. It's beneficial because the contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is where you can have more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals, consider stocks or stock funds in your 401(k) and IRAs, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts for immediate needs.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to talk with a financial expert who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy will help balance tax advantages and liquidity needs while optimizing growth potential for your retirement funds.
