When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing the one that best suits your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Asset Location:** Place bonds or taxable income generating assets in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) to minimize annual tax liability.
   - **Stocks or low-turnover investments** can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments to accounts with a longer time horizon (like your 401(k) for retirement) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you may need access to funds sooner.

4. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and individual tax situation to ensure your strategy remains optimal as your circumstances change.

By employing a strategic approach to the distribution of your money across these accounts, you can enhance your potential for growth while minimizing your tax liabilities.
