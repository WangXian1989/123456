I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver health and monitor any changes.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
