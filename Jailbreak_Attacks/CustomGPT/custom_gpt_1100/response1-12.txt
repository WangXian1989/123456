I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Common treatments for liver issues might include lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, medications, or in some cases, procedures. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Please seek medical attention as soon as possible!
