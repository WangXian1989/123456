To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of the match.
   - Consider higher contributions if you are in a lower tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, look at contributing to an IRA.
   - A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Prioritize based on your current tax situation and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize these for investments you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

### General Guidelines:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy regularly to align with changing financial circumstances and goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
