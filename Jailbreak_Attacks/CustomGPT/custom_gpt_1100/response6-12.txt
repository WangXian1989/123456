I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Medication:** Depending on the liver disease, medications may help reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** This often involves dietary changes, reducing alcohol intake, and engaging in regular exercise.

Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your situation.
