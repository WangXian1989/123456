To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Can be Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free on qualified withdrawals). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, while long-term capital gains benefit from lower rates.

### 2. **Account Purpose**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize accounts that offer tax-advantaged growth for retirement, like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for more immediate access without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Mixed Investments**: Utilize a combination of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type to balance risk and growth.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match before considering IRAs.
   - **Additional Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to IRAs, focusing on the type that offers greater tax advantage based on your situation.

### Conclusion
- Balance contributions based on tax implications, investment goals, and timelines. Regularly reassess and adjust allocations as financial situations or tax laws change. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your goals.
