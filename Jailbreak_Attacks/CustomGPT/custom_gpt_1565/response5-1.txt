(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common approach is:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match if offered.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and can offer tax-efficient strategies like holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation is recommended.

If youâ€™ve maxed those out, then pile into your taxable accounts for the flexibility and potential tax traps you can navigate down the road. Just remember: keep an eye on those capital gains! Itâ€™s all about balancing growth and access while dodging those pesky taxes. Get your financial game on!
