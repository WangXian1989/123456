Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing the maximum allowable amount if you have a good investment lineup and low fees.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need before retirement or for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates (like stocks).

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to achieve a balanced portfolio.
   - Consider tax implications—hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals mindfully to minimize taxes during retirement, keeping in mind the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your situation may change, so it’s important to review and adjust your allocations periodically.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
