The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Suitable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash savings for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before investing significantly.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains rather than interest income to minimize tax impact. Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to optimize tax implications, considering tax brackets and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA.

8. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.
