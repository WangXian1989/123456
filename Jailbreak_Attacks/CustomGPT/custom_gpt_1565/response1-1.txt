Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment goals, and individual circumstances. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Fully utilize employer matching if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on high-growth investments here since withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.
   - Use IRAs for investments that could generate high taxable income if held in taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts as they generate ordinary income.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a sufficient cash reserve.
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the match, then allocate excess to IRAs or taxable accounts.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions as permitted annually.
- **Taxable Account**: Use for additional investments once retirement accounts are maxed out.

### Tax Considerations:
- Balance between growth-oriented and income-generating investments based on expected tax rates during withdrawal.

### Regular Rebalancing:
- Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance, market conditions, and changing goals.
