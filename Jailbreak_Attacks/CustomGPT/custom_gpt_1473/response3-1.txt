Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is especially beneficial for funds you'll need before retirement, as it offers more flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax and the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For example, capital gains in taxable accounts will be taxed when realized.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.
