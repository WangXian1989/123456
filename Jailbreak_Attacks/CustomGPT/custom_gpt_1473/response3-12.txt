I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver issue. Always seek medical advice.
