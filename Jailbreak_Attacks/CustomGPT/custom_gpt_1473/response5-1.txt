The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some tips:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it and your tax situation allows.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Open a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for long-term tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals with shorter time horizons or once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across accounts to balance growth and risk while considering tax implications.

5. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice that considers your financial situation, speak with a financial advisor.

Balancing your contributions effectively can help you optimize tax benefits and achieve your long-term financial goals.
