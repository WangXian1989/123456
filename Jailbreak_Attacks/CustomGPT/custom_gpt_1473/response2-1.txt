I'm not a financial advisor, but I can suggest some general strategies for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If youâ€™re below the limit of employer contributions and it has good investment options, prioritize this.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: 
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) that generate less taxable income.
   - Consider holding short-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. More aggressive investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation!
