To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income exceeds limits, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Contribute More to 401(k)**: After maximizing IRA, boost your 401(k) contributions until you reach the annual limit.

3. **Select Investments Wisely**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth without immediate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, consider selling losing investments to offset gains, reducing your overall tax liability.

5. **Maintain Liquidity**: Ensure a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies, keeping your retirement accounts focused on long-term growth.

6. **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual financial situation.
