Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maximizing contributions if you are in a high tax bracket, as this can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: 
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, benefiting those in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use for savings goals that are short to medium-term (like buying a home or a car).
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Overall Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have accessible savings before investing heavily.
- **Long-Term Focus**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term savings due to tax advantages.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk.

### Regularly Reevaluate
- Adjust your contributions and asset allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
