Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored plan, especially if there's a match. This account allows for tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial for long-term retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, try to max out contributions to take advantage of the tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement, or for goals that are shorter-term. It can also be beneficial for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- Prioritize the 401(k) contributions up to the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions (consider your tax situation).
- Invest additional savings in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
