I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and foods high in sugar and fat.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging.

4. **Surgery**: In advanced cases or for conditions like liver cancer, surgical options may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
