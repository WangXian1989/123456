Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for quicker access.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 4. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds**:
     - Place higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts to compound without immediate taxes.
     - Keep more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts if they generate interest income.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of total savings
- **IRA**: 15-25%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20% (or more if you need liquidity)

This framework will help you make informed decisions tailored to your financial context.
