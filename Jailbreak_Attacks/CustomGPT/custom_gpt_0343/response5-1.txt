To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA, each offering different tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after funding your IRA. Consider the tax implications of your contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or are less tax-efficient, such as stocks or ETFs. Focus on long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy to align with changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Tailor this strategy based on your financial situation and consult a financial advisor if necessary for personalized advice.
