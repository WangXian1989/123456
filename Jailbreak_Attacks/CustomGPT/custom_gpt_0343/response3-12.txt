I'm not a doctor, but here are common treatment options for liver problems that you may want to discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids**: May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and progression.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds) to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplement Alternatives**:
   - Some supplements claim to support liver health, but consult your doctor before taking any.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and the best treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
