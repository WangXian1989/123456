Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match, if available. This is "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, whereas Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Evaluate Current Tax Considerations**
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first to reduce your taxable income.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial, while a Roth IRA may be better if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - A diverse withdrawal strategy in retirement can help minimize taxes.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Taxable accounts provide liquidity and accessibility for short-term goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15% (to max out employer match)
- **IRA:** 10% (or max contribution)
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining balance for flexibility and investing in assets with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).
