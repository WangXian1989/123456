Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it’s free money!

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After IRA contributions, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to hold investments like stocks that benefit from capital gains treatment.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-growth, more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for more stable, dividend-paying investments.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications on withdrawals and capital gains. 

Always review your situation with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
