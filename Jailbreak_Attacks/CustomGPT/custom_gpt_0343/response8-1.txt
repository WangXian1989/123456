When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed yearly, so use them for short-term needs or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRAs) before increasing taxable account contributions.
   - Consider a mix of traditional and Roth accounts based on your current tax rate and expectations for retirement.

4. **Age and Goals**:
   - If younger, lean towards growth in Roth accounts to benefit from compound growth without tax in retirement.
   - Nearer to retirement? Focus on more liquid, accessible assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Place bonds and fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A tailored plan from a professional can address unique circumstances and optimize your strategy.

Following these strategies can help maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
