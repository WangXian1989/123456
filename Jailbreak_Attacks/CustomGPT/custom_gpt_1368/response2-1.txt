The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first step before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional plans), which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your current vs. expected future tax rate, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are less tax-efficient compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment choices should align with your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can be more aggressive in terms of growth potential since you won't need access to that money for a long time. In contrast, funds in taxable accounts might be more conservatively managed if you anticipate needing those funds sooner.

4. **Emergency Fund Considerations**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. This typically should cover 3-6 months of expenses and should be kept in a high-yield savings account or similar low-risk vehicle.

5. **Long-term Investment Strategy**: Allocate funds based on your long-term investment strategy and goals. Often, a good starting point could be contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, followed by maxing out an IRA, and then investing additional funds in your taxable account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change or as you approach your retirement timeline.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, working with a financial advisor can help tailor your asset distribution strategy to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy should reflect your personal circumstances, financial goals, and investment philosophy.
