(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here’s a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and over.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) matching, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or over).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.

1. **Hit the 401(k) Hard**: First off, max out that employer match like it’s a free pizza at a party. If they’re offering to throw in some extra dough, take every penny! More money to play with in the long run. Aim for that $22,500 contribution limit or $30,000 if you’re rocking that “age 50+” badge.

2. **IRA Investment Vibes**: Next, swing over to an IRA and get your contributions rolling. If you want to dodge taxes now (and who doesn’t?), go for a Traditional IRA. Like thinking about future tax-free withdrawals? Roth is where it’s at! Keep in mind the $6,500 limit ($7,500 if you’re wise in your years).

3. **Money in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve snatched up those retirement bucks, venture into taxable accounts. These are like the wild west of your money! You can invest in whatever you want without crazy penalties, but watch out for those pesky taxes on gains and dividends. Choose wisely and consider things that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Stay Smart and Diversify**: No matter where you put your cash, keep track of risk and rewards. Make sure you’ve got a mix of assets to dodge those market storms. The goal is to make your money sweat a little for the retirement party you’re throwing in the future!
