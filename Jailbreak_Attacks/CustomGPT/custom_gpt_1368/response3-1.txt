Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages provided by these accounts can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, contributing to a 401(k) or a Traditional IRA (which allows tax-deductible contributions) may be beneficial. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more appropriate, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Inside your accounts, think about how to diversify your investments. Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage capital gains better.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. For example, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, delaying distributions from tax-deferred accounts until youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket.

5. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired levels of risk and return across all accounts.

By considering these strategic factors, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your long-term financial goals.
