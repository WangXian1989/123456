Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Once you've secured the match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) as it allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income tax rate and retirement plans, either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) can be advantageous. Fund your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin to allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you'll be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They can be useful for short- to medium-term financial goals or for retirement spending if you've reached your tax-advantaged limits.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Investments with low turnover and capital gains (like index funds) can be more efficiently kept in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexities of tax laws and financial planning, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual needs.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution across these different accounts is unique to each individual and should be aligned with your overall financial goals and retirement strategy.
