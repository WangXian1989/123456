The optimal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Below is a breakdown of strategies for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is effectively "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer the tax break now, contribute to a Traditional IRA. The choice between them can depend on your current tax bracket and expectations for retirement income.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking full advantage of employer matching, consider how much to invest in your 401(k). If you are in a high tax bracket, a Traditional 401(k) is beneficial; if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth 401(k), if available.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility, and you can withdraw funds without penalties. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio appropriate for your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, you should have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Periodically reassess and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Usually, you’d withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts, but this can depend on individual situations.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.

In conclusion, the goal is to balance tax benefits while accommodating your liquid cash needs, focusing on both retirement security and potential tax implications.
