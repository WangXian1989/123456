Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments that you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits when selling investments in these accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your retirement age and how soon you’ll need access to funds. Longer horizons can handle more stock exposure, while shorter terms might lean more toward bonds or safer investments.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Consistently contribute to each account as per your strategy, adjusting contributions as your situation changes.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and reallocate as necessary based on performance and changing life circumstances.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
