Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if your employer matches contributions. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs may allow for tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can offer flexibility for withdrawals and a variety of investment options.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower bracket.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to balance risk and growth.

6. **Emergency Funds**: Keep enough liquid savings for emergencies before investing primarily in retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on life changes or shifts in financial goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and needs.
