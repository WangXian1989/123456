Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors such as your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as it’s essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your current and anticipated future tax situation.
   - **Diversification of Taxes**: Having both tax-deferred and post-tax accounts can give you flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts aren't tied to retirement age restrictions or early withdrawal penalties, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from favorable tax rates.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Maintain an asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance, adjusting your investments between accounts as needed.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Keep your long-term goals (like retirement) in focus, and consider how much liquidity you need in the short term.

It’s always wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
