Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which is advantageous in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains) is subject to taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate significant short-term gains.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate in all accounts. Make sure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and reserve Roth accounts for later to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Additional Considerations
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your investment accounts.
- **Financial Goals:** Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals when making investments.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation and goals. They can help create a tailored strategy that maximizes your savings and minimizes your tax burden.
