To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matches and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Options include Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (after-tax contributions). Each has contribution limits and different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits for contributions but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you're eligible, to take advantage of tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to your taxable accounts.

3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts allow quicker access to funds, suitable for short-term needs.
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure diverse asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Typically, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-deferred accounts, while more conservative investments may be suitable for taxable ones to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax treatment of withdrawals from each type of account when planning distributions in retirement.
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax liabilities over time.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Conduct annual reviews of your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, contribution limits, investment performance, and financial goals.
