The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Assess Your Investment Goals**: Determine whether your primary goal is retirement saving, building wealth, or short-term liquidity. This will influence where to allocate funds.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For the 401(k) and IRA, there are annual limits that you cannot exceed.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, tax implications will differ. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends and capital gains. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but can have tax implications annually.

4. **Prioritize Accounts**: Generally, itâ€™s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maxing out an IRA since they can provide tax advantages.

5. **Diversification**: Within your accounts, ensure that you are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation as your financial situation changes, particularly as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can help create a tailored plan that suits your individual needs.

Using these guidelines, you can formulate a balanced approach that fits your financial landscape.
