1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, doctors might prescribe antiviral medications for hepatitis or other specific treatments to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and manage any complications.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They can provide guidance based on your medical history and specific needs.
