I am not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment options. Treatment for liver problems varies depending on the specific condition, so it's important to seek personalized medical advice. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Please consult a doctor for the best options tailored to your situation.
