I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend treatment options based on your specific situation. Treatment may vary depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue, such as lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions. It's important to get personalized advice from a qualified medical professional.
