(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match since this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax advantages. If you still have funds to invest, you can allocate your remaining savings to your taxable accounts. 

Keep in mind that if your income is above a certain threshold, your ability to contribute to a deductible IRA may be limited. Therefore, consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation would be beneficial.
