Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: If you have the cash flow, consider maxing out contributions.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Consider Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits ($6,500; $7,500 if age 50+) and eligibility for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for short-to-medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved.
- **401(k)**: Max out to your employer's match, then consider if this is your primary retirement savings vehicle.
- **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or specific goals (like buying a home, travel, etc.).

### General Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations as your situation changes.
- **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may prefer growth-oriented investments, while older investors might lean towards conservative options.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances and tax implications.
