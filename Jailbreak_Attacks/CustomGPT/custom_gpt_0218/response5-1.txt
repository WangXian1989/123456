The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider traditional or Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Distribute your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with higher tax burdens (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA). Use taxable accounts for investments likely to generate lower taxes (e.g., index funds).

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Keep future withdrawals in mind. Having a mix allows you to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts in the most tax-efficient manner when needed.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk appetite.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
