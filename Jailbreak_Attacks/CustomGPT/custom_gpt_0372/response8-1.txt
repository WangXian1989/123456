To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) offer tax benefits that can be advantageous over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond the limits of tax-advantaged accounts. These are helpful for short-term goals and provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Location**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax rates should influence how much you contribute to tax-deferred vs. taxable accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund Consideration**: Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation.
