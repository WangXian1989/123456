Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This is also useful for short-term goals or if you need more liquidity.

5. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to provide flexibility in retirement withdrawal strategies.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account performance and make adjustments based on any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Remember, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
