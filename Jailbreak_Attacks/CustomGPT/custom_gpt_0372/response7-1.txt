To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match to take advantage of free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have debt with high interest rates, consider paying that down before increasing contributions to any account.

3. **Allocate Investments Wisely**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, prioritize growth-oriented investments since withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax implications. This is a good place for bonds or funds generating capital gains.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Adjust your contributions and investment allocations regularly based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover short-term needs.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that suits your situation.
