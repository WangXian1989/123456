I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis, or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol is crucial.

3. **Nutritional Support**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help support liver function.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
