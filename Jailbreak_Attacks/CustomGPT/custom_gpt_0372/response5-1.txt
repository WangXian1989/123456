Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) first for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet income limits; otherwise, opt for a traditional IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help align your investments with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions based on these factors can optimize your financial growth and minimize taxes over time.
