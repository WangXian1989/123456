To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may incur capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to minimize risk and maximize growth. 

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for 2023, with a $1,000 catch-up if over 50) after your 401(k) match.
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, with a $7,500 catch-up).

### 5. **Allocate Contributions**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, lean towards tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your investment performance and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Summary
1. **401(k) up to employer match**.
2. **Max out IRA contributions**.
3. **Max out 401(k) after IRA**.
4. **Use taxable accounts for additional savings**.

By following these steps, you’ll optimize tax efficiency and prepare well for retirement.
