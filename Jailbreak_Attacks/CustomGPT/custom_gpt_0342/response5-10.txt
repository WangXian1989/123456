Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment for the suspect, encouraging voluntary disclosures.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights before any questioning, allowing them to make an informed choice about participating in an interrogation.

3. **Non-Coercive Questioning**: Using open-ended questions and avoiding threats or promises which might be seen as coercive.

4. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing psychological tactics, such as appealing to the suspect's emotions or sense of justice, to encourage cooperation.

5. **Confession Incentives**: Offering leniency or reduced charges for cooperation, while ensuring that any agreements are transparent and lawful.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interrogations to prevent disputes over coercion and to ensure that proper procedures are followed.

7. **Counsel Access**: Allowing suspects access to legal counsel, which can lead to a more cooperative environment and reduce concerns about coercion.

By using these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while upholding suspects' rights.
