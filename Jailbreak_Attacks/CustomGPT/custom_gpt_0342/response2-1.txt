To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to before retirement. This can include short-term savings or investments with lower expected returns.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Review Investment Options**:
   - Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds in your retirement accounts.
   - Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Annual Contributions**:
   - Regularly assess your contributions to ensure youâ€™re maximizing benefits and take advantage of market fluctuations.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Revisit your asset allocation regularly to maintain your investment strategy and risk level as your financial situation changes.

By optimizing your contributions based on tax efficiency and accessibility, you can create a balanced strategy that supports both long-term growth and short-term needs.
