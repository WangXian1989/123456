To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments, as they can compound without immediate tax implications.
   - Keep lower-growth or more conservative assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: This can offer more investment choices. Use it for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial planner.

Following these strategies can help optimize your investments and minimize tax implications over time.
