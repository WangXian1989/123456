Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are key factors to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, grows tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA before contributing significantly to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Estate Planning**
   - Taxable accounts may be advantageous for estate planning, as they receive a step-up in basis at death.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Maintain enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs without penalties.

### 6. **Investment Strategy**
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds as needed for flexibility and liquidity.

### Regular Review
- Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

This balanced approach helps minimize taxes, maximize growth, and cater to both short and long-term financial goals.
