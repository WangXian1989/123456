To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for higher contribution limits and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term needs or if you need to access funds before retirement age; focus on tax-efficient investments.

3. **Investment Options**: 
   - Look for lower-cost, diversified funds in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds).

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and changes in goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts.

A well-rounded plan considers your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon.
