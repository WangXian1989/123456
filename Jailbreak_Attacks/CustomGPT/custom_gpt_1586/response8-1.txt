Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions are tax-deductible (subject to income limits), and withdrawals will be taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Growth**: Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on capital gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. Keep in mind that gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified not just across accounts, but also within each account. Different types of accounts can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As market conditions change, regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of taxes and investment strategies, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that aligns with your unique financial situation.

Make sure to evaluate your overall financial picture and adjust as your circumstances change over time.
