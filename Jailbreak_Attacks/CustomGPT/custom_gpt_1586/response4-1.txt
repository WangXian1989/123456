Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income now. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, and dividends are taxed as income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings or taxable account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt (like credit cards) before investing significantly.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Consider your overall asset allocation. For example:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which have lower tax rates.

6. **Time Horizon**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards conservative investments in your taxable account while leaving growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your allocations, especially as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for advice tailored to your specific situation. They can provide personalized strategies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall retirement plan.
