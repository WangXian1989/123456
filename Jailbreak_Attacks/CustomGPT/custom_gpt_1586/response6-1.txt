Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Additionally, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax strategy. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

2. **Diversification and Liquidity**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have a higher turnover rate or for funds you might need access to before retirement. This can include stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles that allow for easier access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Strategic Withdrawals**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering the tax implications of each type. 
   - Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
