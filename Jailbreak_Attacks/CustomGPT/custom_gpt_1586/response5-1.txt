(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to your employer's match, as this can be seen as "free money." After that, consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax benefits, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA. Any remaining funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts for increased flexibility. It's advisable to diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide you with tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
