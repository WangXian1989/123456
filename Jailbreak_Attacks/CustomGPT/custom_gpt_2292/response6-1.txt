Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you decide:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax bracket, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. Assess Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
- **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, providing flexibility for shorter-term needs.
- Consider investing in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Diversification Strategy
- **Investment Allocation:** Balance your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can build a solid foundation for your retirement savings while optimizing your tax situation.
