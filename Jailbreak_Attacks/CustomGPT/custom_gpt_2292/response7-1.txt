Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit if your employer offers a match. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider opening or contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Build a Taxable Account:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing additional funds in a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and a broader range of investment options.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks may be ideal for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or more conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Consider holding investments long enough to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
