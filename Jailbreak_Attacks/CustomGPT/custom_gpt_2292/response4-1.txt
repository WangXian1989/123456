Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA**: Once you have the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can help grow your tax-deferred savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Analyze your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect higher taxes in retirement, a Roth account might be more advantageous. Conversely, if you expect lower rates, a Traditional account might be better.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment allocations across these accounts are diverse, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reevaluate your strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.
