To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if eligible.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, contribute here after tax; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it a good long-term option.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends. Use for investments you might need to access sooner.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments by spreading across stocks, bonds, and other assets. Adjust based on your age and risk tolerance.

4. **Consider tax efficiency:** 
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or municipal bonds).

5. **Regular Review:** Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio based on your goals, market conditions, and any changes in your financial situation.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific needs and goals.
