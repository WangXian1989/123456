1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antiviral medications** for viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** or other immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Ultrasound or other imaging studies to assess the liverâ€™s condition.

4. **Advanced Therapies**:
   - In severe cases, consider **liver transplant** if the liver is damaged beyond repair.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan specific to your liver condition.
