To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-deferred accounts**: Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts grow tax-free until withdrawal, which can significantly enhance your long-term growth.
   - **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. long-term**: Place more aggressive investments that have higher growth potential in your tax-deferred accounts (since you'll defer taxes on any gains). Reserve more conservative investments for taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens on dividends and interest.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Maximize contributions**: Ensure you’re contributing enough to meet any employer matching in your 401(k)—this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider income limits**: Be aware of income limits attached to traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, particularly if you're considering conversions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Plan for retirement**: Strategize about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize your tax liabilities, ensure longevity of assets, and maintain income levels.

By strategically distributing your assets across these accounts, you can optimize for both growth and tax efficiency. Always reevaluate your strategy as tax laws and your financial situation evolve.
