I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consider consulting a healthcare professional. Liver problems can range widely, so it's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, medications, or in severe cases, surgical interventions like liver transplants. Always prioritize professional medical advice for such conditions.
