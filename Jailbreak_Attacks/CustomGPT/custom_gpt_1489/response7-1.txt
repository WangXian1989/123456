To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize pre-tax accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts to maintain liquidity. These can serve as an emergency fund or for goals within a shorter time frame.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices in each account align with your overall risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing goals, tax situation, and market conditions.

By strategically allocating funds, you can balance tax benefits with flexibility and long-term growth potential.
