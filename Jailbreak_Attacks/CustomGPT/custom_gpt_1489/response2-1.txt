To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. If possible, max it out to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

2. **Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Hold assets that generate ordinary income (bonds, REITs) here. They'll grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for high-growth assets like stocks. Since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, this maximizes growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) that generate qualified dividends and capital gains here.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Don't over-concentrate in one account type. 

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Understand your current and expected future tax rates. This can influence how much you should allocate to each account type.

This balanced and strategic approach leverages tax efficiencies while ensuring growth potential across your investments.
