(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Generally, you might want to prioritize:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy. A Roth can be beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, where you can invest without contribution limits. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts boils down to what you're aiming for and your risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a real talk approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer's throwing in a match, max that out first. Seriously, it's like a bonus for just contributing. Donâ€™t leave free money on the table!
2. **IRA**: Next, dive into an IRAâ€”go for a Roth if you think youâ€™ll be swimming in a higher tax bracket down the line. Why pay taxes now when you can skate by tax-free later?
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you're maxed out on those accounts, toss whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and are great for short-term goals, but don't forget about those pesky capital gains taxes!
