   - **Interactive Formats:** Use videos, polls, and Q&A sessions to involve young voters in discussions on these issues, fostering a sense of community and urgency.

### 3. **Events and Activations:**
   - **Local Events:** Host concerts, community service days, or forums that allow young voters to engage directly with candidates and causes.
