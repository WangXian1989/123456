I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing sugar, saturated fats, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and support liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help reduce viral loads and liver inflammation.
   - **Supplements**: Some supplements, such as milk thistle, may offer liver support, but consult your doctor first.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.
   - **Endoscopy**: In cases of varices or other complications, procedures might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to tailor a treatment plan that suits your specific needs.
