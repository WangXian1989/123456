Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s free money, so don’t leave it on the table!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have high contribution limits and your employer matches, prioritize funding this first.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you want to actively manage your investments.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to spread risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly check your allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your target distribution.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure or have specific circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

Always consider fees, tax implications, and your overall financial plan when deciding how to allocate your funds.
