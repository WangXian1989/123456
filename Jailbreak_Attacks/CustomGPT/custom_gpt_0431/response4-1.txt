Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guiding strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your Traditional or Roth IRA contributions depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal. In contrast, investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, this can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation across accounts based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - If you’re saving for specific goals (like buying a house), consider maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to continue growing.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized assistance tailored to your specific financial situation.
