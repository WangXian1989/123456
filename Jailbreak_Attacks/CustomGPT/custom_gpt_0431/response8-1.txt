When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. Focus on contributing to these accounts first, especially if you can deduct IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, which often have lower capital gains distributions.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for more aggressive investments if your time horizon is long, as you wonâ€™t incur taxes on growth until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Diversify with a focus on cash flow-producing or low-turnover investments to minimize tax implications.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage tax brackets (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow).

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. In 2023, for example, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

6. **Consider Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

Always assess your financial situation regularly and adjust your strategy as needed.
