Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your employer's plan to get any matching contributions. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, put additional savings into taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be cautious of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Ensure you're investing in a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

### 4. **Investment Horizon:**
   - For accounts intended for long-term goals (like retirement), you can typically take on more risk. Shorter time horizons should focus on more conservative investments.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary.

### Sample Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of income to get the match, up to the contribution limit.
- **IRA:** Max out the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are prioritized, distribute any remaining savings here for flexibility and additional investment.
