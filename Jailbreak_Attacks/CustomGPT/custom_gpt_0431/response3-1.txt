To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally has higher contribution limits and offers tax deferral. Check if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): IRAs offer tax advantages; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax on investments.

2. **Set Your Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement age, desired lifestyle, and risk tolerance.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term savings. Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within a few years.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - For example, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

5. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match first.
   - Then, consider contributing to an IRA (preferably maxing out a Roth if you qualify).
   - Lastly, allocate any excess savings to taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary, considering market changes and personal circumstances.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If needed, consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

These steps can help create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
