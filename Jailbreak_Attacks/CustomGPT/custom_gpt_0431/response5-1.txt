(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (if you prefer the tax deduction now).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual stocks or funds that pay frequent dividends. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

It's often beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before using taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

1. **Go for the Free Money**: First, stuff as much cash into your 401(k) as you need to grab that employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave that on the table! That's like walking away from free pizza!

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re young and expect to earn more later, Roth IRAs could be your jam. If youâ€™re older and need the tax break now, go for that Traditional IRA. 

3. **Donâ€™t Forget the Taxable Accounts**: Finally, throw some cash into taxable accounts for flexibilityâ€”these bad boys let you access your money without all those pesky withdrawal penalties. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxes; nobody likes a surprise tax bill!

Remember, everyoneâ€™s situation is different, so tweak these tips to match your financial goals!
