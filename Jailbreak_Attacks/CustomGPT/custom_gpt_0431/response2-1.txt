Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth accounts offer tax-free growth; Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund 401(k) Up to Annual Limit**: Once you’ve maximized other accounts (including any traditional IRAs), increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have savings beyond retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals and can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Focus on long-term growth through stocks or a diversified mix of index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or other tax-efficient investments due to different tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax impacts of withdrawals and investment gains in each account type to optimize your strategy.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.
