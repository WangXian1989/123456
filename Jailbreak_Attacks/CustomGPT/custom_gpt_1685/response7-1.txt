The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First:** After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA, whether it’s a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice between these accounts depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maximized your retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. While you won’t get the tax advantages of retirement accounts, this gives you more flexibility in terms of access to your money and investment choices.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** If you have short-term goals (buying a home, for example), you might prefer to put more money in a taxable account. For long-term goals (retirement), heavily funding tax-advantaged accounts is usually more beneficial.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally speaking, your retirement accounts are often best used for longer-term, growth-oriented investments.

6. **Evaluate Tax Implications:** Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds from these accounts, especially from taxable accounts, which may realize capital gains. 

It's always a good idea to speak with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
