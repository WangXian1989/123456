Creating an optimal distribution strategy for your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to help you balance your portfolio effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax-deferral or tax-free growth.
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, and then assess whether to increase contributions beyond that limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Choose a mix of investments in your 401(k) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible; for a Roth IRA, consider making contributions if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Maximize contributions to IRAs if you have available funds after meeting your 401(k) contributions and other financial goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) or hold bonds, as these are generally taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Revisit Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.
   - Periodically rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain the desired allocation.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals from these accounts in a way that minimizes taxes. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (Roth).

It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances, including income levels and retirement plans. This can help you maximize growth while managing risk and tax implications effectively.
