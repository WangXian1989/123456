Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These may be appropriate for investments you may need access to before retirement or if you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Investment Type:** Hold investments that produce capital gains in taxable accounts and income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. Factor in Investment Goals
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use a taxable account for more liquid investments.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Aim for max contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for compounded growth.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Adjust allocations based on liquidity needs and tax implications.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation. 

By applying these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective approach to managing your retirement wealth.
