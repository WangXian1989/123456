To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Place lower-growth or fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep in mind the withdrawal rules for each account type. Generally, taxable accounts are best for early withdrawals, while retirement accounts are best left to grow until retirement.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Getting personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
