Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover funds or individual stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), affecting your overall tax burden.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of equities, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Long-Term Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Consider at what age you'll need to access funds; early withdrawals can incur penalties.
   - **RMDs**: Recognize that 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts require minimum distributions starting at age 73.

### Summary of Steps
- Start with employer match in the 401(k).
- Max out IRA contributions.
- Use taxable accounts for excess savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

By aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, you can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
