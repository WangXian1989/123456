I'm not a doctor, but if youâ€™re experiencing liver issues, consider these general treatment options:

1. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet (low-fat, high in fruits and vegetables).
   - Avoid alcohol and reduce exposure to toxic substances.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds to assess liver health.

4. **Supplementary Treatments**: 
   - Milk thistle or other natural remedies (consult your doctor).

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
