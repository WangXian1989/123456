I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures, depending on the condition. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Other medications tailored to specific liver conditions.

3. **Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor for personalized advice.
