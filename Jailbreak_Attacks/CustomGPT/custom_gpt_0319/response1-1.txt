Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax benefits now, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA, whether traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Long-term investments can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your risk appetite should determine your asset allocation across these accounts.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k)** to get any employer match.
- After that, assess whether a Traditional or Roth IRA suits your situation.
- Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### Regular Reviews:
- Rebalance your allocations periodically based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor strategies specific to your needs.
