Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRAs**
   - After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth options) for the tax advantages.

### 3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable distributions. This can include investments that are taxed at lower capital gains rates.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since these grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 4. **Consider your Time Horizon**
   - For short-term goals (within 5 years), keep the funds in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals, prioritize retirement accounts for better growth potential.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations across accounts to stay in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications to minimize your overall tax bill.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
