To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions here if you have a generous match.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; good for reducing taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds needed before retirement or for more flexibility. Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, higher-risk assets (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shield from taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in savings to cover emergencies before investing heavily.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals, time horizon, and retirement plans.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
