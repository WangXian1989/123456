To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRAs for Tax Benefits**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (for tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This allows for more flexible access to funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can be spread out to manage risk better.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax liability. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less frequent income, like index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess your distribution and adjust contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
