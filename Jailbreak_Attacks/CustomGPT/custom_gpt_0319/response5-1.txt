Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50, and $30,500 for those 50+.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment Options:** You can invest in a variety of assets. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### **Strategy**
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** Max out your 401(k) match, then work on your IRA.
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread investments across a mix of asset classes in each account.
- **Consider Tax Implications:** Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### **Overall Balance**
- Determine an allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance, like:
   - **Aggressive:** More in stocks, less in bonds.
   - **Conservative:** More in bonds, less in stocks.

Regularly revisit your distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
