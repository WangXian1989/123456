Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for those under 50, as of 2023).
   - Choose investments that align with your long-term goals while considering your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your income level will influence eligibility and tax implications.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed in an IRA ($6,500 for those under 50, as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility.
   - Taxable accounts are useful for short- to medium-term goals and offer more liquidity.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:

- **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and industries.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months’ expenses).
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively helps to optimize growth while managing risk and tax implications.

### Summary
1. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) for employer match.
2. If applicable, maximize IRA contributions for tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investments. 

This structured approach can help secure a solid financial future.
