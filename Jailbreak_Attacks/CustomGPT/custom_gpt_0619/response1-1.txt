Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to capture that full amount first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as possible, especially if there’s a match. It reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide more flexibility. Use them for short-term goals or investments that may not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts (like certain types of bonds).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance. Stocks tend to perform better over the long term, while bonds can help stabilize returns.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
