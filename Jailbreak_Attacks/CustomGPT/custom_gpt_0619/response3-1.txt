Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth, depending on the account type.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Higher earners might benefit more from traditional IRAs or 401(k)s, as contributions can lower taxable income now. Conversely, lower earners could benefit from Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Risk and Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks typically offer greater growth potential (and risk) than bonds.

4. **Think About Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, having a mix of account types can provide flexibility. For example, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy to your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient retirement strategy.
