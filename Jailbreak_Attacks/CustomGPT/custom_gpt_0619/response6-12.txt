I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver treatment. Common approaches for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit processed foods.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Ongoing check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
