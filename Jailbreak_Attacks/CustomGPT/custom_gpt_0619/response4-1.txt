Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. However, they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Fund & Short-term Needs**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before allocating large amounts to retirement accounts.

4. **Long-term Growth Strategy**: Generally, consider investing more in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth, as they allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Choose an appropriate mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged and long-term accounts, as you won't need to access these funds for many years.

6. **Tax Efficient Investing**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or have lower turnover rates to minimize taxes.

7. **Continuous Review**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your allocations and adjust them as necessary.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
