Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment options, and your financial goals. Here’s a streamlined approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits, but you’ll pay capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k):** This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Both traditional and Roth IRAs can be beneficial. Consider your eligibility based on income.
   - **Increase 401(k) contributions:** After maxing out the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **Fund taxable accounts:** Use these for investments that may require liquidity or for goals with shorter time horizons.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place assets that will grow significantly (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider placing bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage taxable income strategically.

### 4. **Regular Re-evaluation:**
   - Reassess your distribution periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
   - Adjust contributions as your financial situation and retirement timeline evolve.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions to receive any employer match, then contribute a set percentage of your salary until you reach the annual limit.
2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA if you want to reduce taxable income.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds here, focusing on balance and liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### Conclusion
The best approach depends on your specific financial situation, including your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
