I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: These may involve adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and increasing physical activity.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progress.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek advice from a medical professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
