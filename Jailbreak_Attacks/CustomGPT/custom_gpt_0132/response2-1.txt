To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account offers tax-deferred growth. If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this account to capitalize on the match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Aim to max your IRA contributions if you're eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments. If you expect to take money out before retirement, consider keeping more liquid and lower-risk investments in these accounts to manage tax exposure.
   - Ensure that you understand the implications of withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts before retirement age, as penalties can apply.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are likely to grow substantially, while holding more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalancing may help you maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds from these accounts efficiently to minimize taxes and prolong your retirement savings.

Consider discussing your specific financial situation with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your long-term goals.
