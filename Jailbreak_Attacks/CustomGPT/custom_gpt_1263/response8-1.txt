To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on placing investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) or high-growth assets (like stocks) in these accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate lower taxable income or for assets with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends and capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to employer-matched 401(k) plans to take full advantage of the match.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account, while keeping in mind the overall risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan an optimal withdrawal strategy for retirement. Consider which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications, such as keeping tax-deferred accounts intact longer.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity outside retirement accounts for unexpected expenses, which can affect your investment strategy.

6. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific goals and situation.

By balancing tax implications, growth potential, and liquidity needs, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
