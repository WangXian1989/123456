Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes. Consider putting investments that are expected to generate significant capital gains here, keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts, depending on your tax bracket.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Evaluate Regularly:**
   - Review your allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Summary:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out IRA contributions (consider tax implications).
3. Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment.
4. Diversify investments based on risk and tax impact.
5. Regularly reassess your strategy.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% of income
- **IRA:** Max contribution annually
- **Taxable Account:** Remainder after maxing out 401(k) and IRA
