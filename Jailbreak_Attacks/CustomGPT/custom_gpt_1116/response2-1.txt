Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)
If your employer offers a match on contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Contribute to an IRA
Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and future tax strategy:
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, with taxes due on withdrawals in retirement.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Focus on 401(k) Contributions
If you have maxed out your IRA contributions (the limits for 2024 are $6,500 for individuals under 50, and $7,500 for those 50 and older), increase your contributions to your 401(k). The annual limit for 2024 is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. Invest in Taxable Accounts
Funds in taxable accounts can offer more flexibility and liquidity. Consider contributing to these accounts if:
- You've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
- You want to invest for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home).
- You prefer diversified investments not bound by retirement account rules.

### 5. Diversification
Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance when selecting investments.

### 6. Adjust Based on Taxes
Evaluate the tax implications of your distributions and investment strategies in each account:
- Capital gains tax on taxable accounts.
- Ordinary income tax on 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals.
- No taxes on qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA.

### 7. Periodic Review
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 30-50% (max high-interest offerings)
- **IRA**: 20-30% (choose traditional or Roth based on your tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30% (focus on long-term growth investments)

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance can be valuable, especially considering your unique financial situation and goals.
