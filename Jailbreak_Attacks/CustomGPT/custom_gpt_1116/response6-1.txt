Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribution**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Limit**: For 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $23,000, or $30,500 if you're 50 or older.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions):
     - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Generally better if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Limit**: The contribution limit for IRA accounts is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2024.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as:
     - Index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower capital gains distributions.
     - Municipal bonds, which may be tax-exempt.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your short-term financial goals (e.g., saving for a home) which may be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolios to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account in retirement. 
   - **Distributions**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match and contribute as much as you can.
- **IRA**: Choose between Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation and contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles and maintain liquidity if needed.
