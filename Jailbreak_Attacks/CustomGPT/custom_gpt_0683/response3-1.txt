Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since these accounts don’t have the tax benefits of retirement accounts, consider holding investments like ETFs or index funds that produce fewer taxable events.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Tend to be ideal for long-term growth; consider holding more aggressive investments here since withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary income rate in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient and consider setting aside cash for short-term needs.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

Ultimately, a well-balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged growth while considering risk tolerance and time horizon will yield the best results. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
