Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you have the option, consider putting money into an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs often have a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s and can offer tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility, as you can access the money without penalties and can choose investments that might have favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** The type of account can affect your tax situation. For instance, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. In a taxable account, capital gains and dividends are taxed differently.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to manage risk effectively. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Summary:
- Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for added flexibility after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.
- Be mindful of tax implications associated with each account type.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
