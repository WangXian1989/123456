I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the underlying condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. It's crucial to work closely with your doctor to determine the most appropriate course of action based on your specific situation.
