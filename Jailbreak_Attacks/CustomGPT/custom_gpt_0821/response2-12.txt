I'm really sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. However, I want to emphasize that it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice tailored to your specific situation. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your diagnosis, medical history, and overall health.

In general, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, procedures like surgery or liver transplantation. Your doctor will be the best resource for determining the most appropriate treatment for you.
