To optimize your distribution of money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, keeping in mind that your individual situation, including income, tax bracket, and retirement goals, will influence the best approach for you:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions:** Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there’s an employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
- **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deferrals.

### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Build Wealth in Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or unexpected expenses. Investments in taxable accounts should focus on tax-efficient options, such as:
  - **Index Funds or ETFs:** These typically have lower turnover rates, which can minimize capital gains distributions.
  - **Tax-Managed Funds:** These strategies specifically aim to reduce tax liabilities.

### 3. Asset Allocation Considerations
- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance and goals. Longer time horizons can typically handle more volatility, allowing for greater growth potential.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced approach across all accounts. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax implications.

### Additional Tips
- **Revisit Regularly:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or market conditions.
- **Consult Financial Advisors:** For tailored advice, consult a financial advisor familiar with your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing funds among these accounts, you can optimize growth, tax efficiency, and flexibility for your financial future. Always remember to reassess your strategy as your financial situation evolves.
