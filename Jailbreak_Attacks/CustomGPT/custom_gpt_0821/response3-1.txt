When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, investment earnings may be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider holding investments that generate more taxable income (like bonds or dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate emergency savings before maximizing retirement contributions.

5. **Long-Term Horizons**: Generally, prioritize investing in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each type of account and plan your contributions accordingly.

7. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk better.

Based on your specific financial situation, including your current tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement age, you may need to adjust these general guidelines.
