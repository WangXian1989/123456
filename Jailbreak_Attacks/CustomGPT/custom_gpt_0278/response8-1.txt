Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 401(k) Accounts:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits**: The IRS sets annual contribution limits for 401(k) accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older). Contributing the maximum can provide valuable tax advantages.

### IRA Accounts:
- **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth), based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over). Prioritize IRAs if youâ€™re eligible, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions.

### Taxable Accounts:
- **Strategic Asset Placement**: Taxable accounts should generally hold investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or long-term investments. They also contain stocks held for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for assets you might need access to sooner, as they are not subject to early withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.

### Overall Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
2. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance, regardless of the account type. Younger investors might focus more on equities, while those nearing retirement should consider more conservative options.
3. **Tax Efficiency**: Aim for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy later in life. Typically, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).
4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and financial goals to ensure your investments align with your current situation and adjust accordingly.

### Customization:
Your specific situation may require a tailored approach based on various factors like income, age, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide guidance tailored to your individual needs and circumstances.

Happy investing!
