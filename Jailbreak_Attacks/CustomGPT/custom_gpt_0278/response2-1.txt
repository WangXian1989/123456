Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax strategy).

### 2. **Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income today. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax-deductible contributions, but taxes are due upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA, funded with post-tax dollars, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is valuable if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but come with tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use these for assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualify for tax breaks, such as holding investments for over a year.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally offer higher returns but come with more volatility. Bonds provide stability but usually lower returns.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. Put higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if you have complex financial situations. They can provide tailored strategies that consider your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
A typical approach might look like this:
1. Max out the 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA based on tax considerations.
3. Use residual funds for taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments there.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so adjusting this strategy based on personal circumstances is crucial. Happy investing!
