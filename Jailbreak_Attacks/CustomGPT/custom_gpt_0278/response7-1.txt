It's great that you're thinking about how to optimize your investment strategy! The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k):** Contributing enough to get any employer match is crucial, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if you can. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA:** If you're eligible for a traditional IRA, consider maxing that out after your 401(k) contributions, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement. If you prefer tax-free growth, consider a Roth IRA, where contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for flexibility and liquidity. Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts. They’re particularly suitable for investments you may need access to before retirement age.

The key is to evaluate your whole financial picture, including your current tax bracket, anticipated tax bracket in retirement, and investment goals. It might also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

Happy investing!
