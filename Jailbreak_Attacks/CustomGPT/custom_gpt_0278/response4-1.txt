When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy you choose can vary based on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key considerations for managing your investments across these account types:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the funds offered in your 401(k) and consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds to diversify your investments.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation now and when you expect to retire, you may prefer one over the other.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits and age-related catch-up contributions if you're over 50.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties. They can be a good place for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for longer periods to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Before allocating funds, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place.
   - **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This can include stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.
   - **Regular Contributions:** Set up regular contributions across all accounts based on your financial capability and retirement goals.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Market conditions and personal circumstances change; regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### Pros and Cons:
- **401(k)**: 
  - Pros: Employer match, tax-deferred growth.
  - Cons: Limited investment options.
  
- **IRA**: 
  - Pros: Flexible investment choices, potential for tax-free growth (Roth).

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help you create a balanced strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals. Happy investing!
