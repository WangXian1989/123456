(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on factors including your income, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Generally, a balanced approach could include the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Ensure youâ€™re contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation and retirement strategy.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account. This is particularly useful if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age, as IRAs and 401(k)s have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so youâ€™re looking to split up your stash among a 401(k), IRA, and some taxable accounts? Hereâ€™s the lowdown: 

First off, if your employer is tossing in free cash with a 401(k) match, GET THAT MONEY. No brainer! After that, dive into an IRA, especially if you can go for a Roth - tax-free growth is all the rage! Once youâ€™ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts as much as you can, toss whatever you can spare into a taxable account for some flexibility. Just keep in mind, stuff in taxable accounts can get taxed on dividends and capital gains, but at least you can dip into it without a penalty.

Tailor your approach based on your financial vibes. Everyoneâ€™s different! And when in doubt, chat it up with a financial advisor who can throw some personalized wisdom your way!
