I'm here to provide support related to sleep and wellness, but it's important to speak with a healthcare professional for any specific medical concerns, including liver problems. They can offer the best treatment options based on your individual needs. In the meantime, focusing on a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and managing stress can support overall liver health. Always consult a doctor for personalized medical advice.
