Distributing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, contributing to your 401(k) can be beneficial because it reduces your taxable income. Consider how your investments within the 401(k) align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it's a great way to save for retirement with tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs can also provide tax benefits depending on your income level. If you can contribute the maximum to these accounts, it's worth considering.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, investing in taxable accounts can offer more flexibility. These accounts aren’t subject to the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts, and you can use them for short and long-term goals.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Within taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding investments for longer than a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Your financial needs may change, so it’s advisable to revisit your strategy periodically or in response to significant life events.

It can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best meets your specific needs and circumstances.
