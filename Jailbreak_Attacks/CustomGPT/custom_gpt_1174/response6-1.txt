When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to incorporate factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and provides tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investments for any savings beyond your retirement accounts. This allows for flexibility and can be a source for short-term goals.

### 2. **Consider Investment Strategy**  
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts. For your 401(k) and IRA, lean towards higher-growth investments that may generate significant taxable events if held outside of tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring that your total investment strategy aligns with your financial objectives.

### 3. **Monitor and Adjust**  
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions. This proactive approach ensures you remain on track toward your goals.

By strategically allocating your resources among these three types of accounts, you can optimize your investment returns while managing tax implications effectively. If you have specific goals or circumstances, adjustments may be necessary to better align with your overall financial plan.
