Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want an immediate tax deduction, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future; contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Be aware of contribution limits for both types of IRAs, and ensure you are within those limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access sooner than retirement accounts.
   - Investing in low-turnover assets or tax-efficient funds can help minimize capital gains taxes.
   - It's also a good option for investment strategies that can yield tax-loss harvesting benefits.

**General Strategy**:
- Start by maximizing any tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before distributing large sums into taxable accounts.
- Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts to stay in line with your risk tolerance and overall investment strategy.
- Periodically rebalance your investments to maintain your desired allocation.

Ultimately, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your unique circumstances.
