To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Your Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and may have employer matching. Consider maxing this out, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Short-term vs. long-term: Determine if you need funds in the short term (likely better suited for taxable accounts) or are saving for retirement (focus more on retirement accounts).
   - Risk tolerance: Higher-risk investments can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) where taxes on gains are deferred.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available).
   - Contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on eligibility and tax implications.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-growth investments (that you intend to hold long-term) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically revisit your allocation based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and help optimize your asset allocation across these accounts.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
