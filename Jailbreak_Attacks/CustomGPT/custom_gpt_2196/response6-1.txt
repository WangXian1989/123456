To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Accounts**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are owed upon withdrawal in retirement. Consider maxing this out if your employer offers matching contributions, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax bracket versus your expected bracket in retirement to determine which is more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income in these accounts is taxable in the year earned. Use these for more liquid investments or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Allocate Based on Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. This protects your investments from taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner. This allows for flexibility without penalties associated with early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### Suggested Allocation Breakdown
- Max out employer match on 401(k) first.
- If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- Use any remaining funds for additional contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.
- Allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

By following these strategic considerations, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
