Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking full advantage of the match, consider the contribution limits. The 401(k) allows for higher contributions compared to IRAs, so if you can, put more in your 401(k) while focusing on investment options.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. The choice between the two often depends on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have extra funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of access to your money but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is many years away, focus on growth (potentially higher-risk investments) in tax-advantaged accounts. If you’re closer to retirement, consider shifting toward more stable, income-producing investments.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all account types to mitigate risk. Different accounts may also offer varied investment options, beneficial for a balanced portfolio.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review your investment strategy to adapt to life changes or market conditions.
