I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes (like antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and assess the progression of the disease.

4. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: Managing any related health issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can help improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, such as liver cancer or significant damage from cirrhosis, surgical options or liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
