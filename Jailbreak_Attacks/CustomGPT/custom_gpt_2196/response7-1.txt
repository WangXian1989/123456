Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, it’s typically best to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider how much you can contribute while balancing your other financial goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing any 401(k) match, you could consider contributing to an IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, this can be advantageous due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains. This can be a good place to invest funds after you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts or if you anticipate needing access to the money before retirement.

4. **Balancing Your Investments:** Aim for diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon; typically, younger investors might lean more heavily into stocks, while those closer to retirement might want a higher allocation to bonds.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind that investments that generate ordinary income (like interest) can be more tax-efficient in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while investments with long-term capital gains might be better suited for taxable accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy can vary based on individual circumstances. It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that considers your specific goals and needs.
