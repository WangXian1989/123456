Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money" that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not. Depending on your income, you might consider:
   - Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions (taxes during withdrawal).
   - 401(k) contributes pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

3. **Consider Income Tax Levels**: If you are in a lower tax bracket, it may be more beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA, while higher earners may prefer the traditional IRA for its immediate tax benefits.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your financial goals:
   - For long-term growth, focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need access to funds sooner or have shorter-term goals, consider keeping more in taxable accounts where you can easily withdraw without penalties.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**: Plan for rebalancing your portfolio regularly and consider the implications of drawing funds from different accounts when you retire. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may be subject to income tax.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because every individual's financial situation is unique, it's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can create a tailored plan to optimize your contributions and withdrawals strategy.

Remember, the best strategy for you will depend on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and market conditions.
