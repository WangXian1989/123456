Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them an excellent choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though they are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
