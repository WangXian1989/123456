To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to these accounts, as they offer tax benefits.
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating to other accounts.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Portfolio Balance**: Regularly adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can help manage risk and optimize returns.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of your tax bracket when planning withdrawals post-retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

By strategically allocating your resources, you can enhance growth while managing tax implications effectively.
