To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. Three to six months’ worth of expenses is a good target.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing when you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. They’re flexible for withdrawals and suitable for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to achieve a balanced portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
