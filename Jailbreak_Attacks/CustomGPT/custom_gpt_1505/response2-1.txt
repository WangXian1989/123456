The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk.

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: If youâ€™re investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for money you might need sooner.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to all accounts, adjusting as necessary based on any changes in income or financial goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your investments and allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.
