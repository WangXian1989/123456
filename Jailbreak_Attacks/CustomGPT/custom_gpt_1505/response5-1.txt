(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy would be to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as it can provide immediate returns. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional funds, especially if you need flexibility or have already maxed out retirement accounts. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that best fits your individual circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! You want a killer strategy for your cash flow? First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer is chucking in free money through matching contributions – don’t leave that on the table! Next up, consider diving into an IRA; if you're eligible for a Roth, do it! It’s tax-free withdrawals during retirement, which is freakin' awesome. Then, splurge a little in your taxable account for flexibility – it’s like your “fun money” for after-retirement adventures! Just remember, balancing risk and returns is key, so keep an eye on how you're allocating those assets across all accounts. Get a pro on the horn if you want to supercharge that strategy!
