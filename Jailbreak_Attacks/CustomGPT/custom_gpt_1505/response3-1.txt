The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Strategies like placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-producing investments in taxable accounts can be effective.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
