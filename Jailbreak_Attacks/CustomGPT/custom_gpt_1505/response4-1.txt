The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have the same tax benefits but offer flexibility since you can withdraw money anytime without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Adjust your contributions accordingly.

4. **Debt Considerations:** If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before maximizing your retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before channeling excess funds into long-term investments.

6. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, consider your asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Long-Term Strategy:** In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for retirement savings and consider using taxable accounts for short-term goals or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged options.

8. **Adjust as Needed:** Your distribution strategy should be flexible. Regularly review and adjust your account contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
