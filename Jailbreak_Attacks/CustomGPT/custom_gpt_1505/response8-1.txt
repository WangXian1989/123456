The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - If you’re eligible, consider a Backdoor Roth IRA if you're over the income limits for direct contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, especially if you plan to access these funds before retirement. 
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts; aim for long-term capital gains when possible.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds can be beneficial in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Considerations**:
   - Review your investment options in each account type; different accounts may have different investment choices and fees.
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and reallocate based on performance and financial goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances and goals. They can help you optimize your overall investment strategy and account allocations based on your specific situation.
