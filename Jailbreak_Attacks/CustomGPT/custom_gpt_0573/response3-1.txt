Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) may provide more immediate benefits. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth account might be better.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Understand that investments in taxable accounts will incur capital gains tax when sold for a profit. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For a longer time horizon, you might lean more towards stocks (higher potential growth) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   
By maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, considering your tax situation, diversifying appropriately, and planning your withdrawal strategy, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money across these accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
