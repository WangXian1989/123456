Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Aim to max out your contributions if you can. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 (plus $1,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term gains. These accounts usually have fewer tax advantages but offer flexibility.
   - Consider keeping investments in taxable accounts that may be subject to lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or long-term holdings.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to manage risk effectively.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies, placing less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide more personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
