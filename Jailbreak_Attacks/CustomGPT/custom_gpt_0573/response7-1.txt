Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available to you. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** After taking advantage of the match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Roth Options:** If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Think about contributing to a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and can be used for short-term savings or investments that might not fit into tax-deferred accounts (like real estate or certain stocks).

5. **Assets Allocation:** Within these accounts, consider a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks might be better for long-term growth in tax-deferred accounts, while bonds or more conservative investments can fit into taxable accounts to mitigate tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always ensure your contributions and investment choices align with your overall financial strategy and retirement goals.
