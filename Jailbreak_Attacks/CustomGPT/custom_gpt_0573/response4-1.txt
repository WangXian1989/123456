Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) regarding tax benefits, but with different contribution limits and income restrictions for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this account.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider using these accounts for investments that generate lower turnover or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth since they allow your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For funds you may need before retirement, consider keeping them in taxable accounts for more accessible withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your desired asset allocation across accounts. It might be beneficial to hold different types of investments (e.g., stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts) to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term objectives.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances and goals.
