Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that takes into account your goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. 
   - Consider keeping bonds or other fixed-income investments in tax-deferred accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

3. **Retirement Accounts Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   
4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for shorter-term savings and investments that may have different tax implications. Focus on investments like index funds which may generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Ensure a balanced allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess and rebalance your allocations annually to adjust for market changes and shifts in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial planner who can provide tailored recommendations based on your specific situation.
