(🔒Normal Output) To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which offer benefits such as tax deferral or tax-free growth. 

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and the time frame for those goals. Generally, the longer your investment horizon, the more you can afford to invest in stocks for growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, like bonds, or for investments you might need to access soon.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down in a way that makes sense without the usual fluff:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer’s throwing in free money with a match, get that first! Pour in as much as you can up to the match—it’s like a no-brainer.

2. **IRA Magic**: Once you're maxing out the 401(k) match, look at IRAs next. If you can, go for a Roth IRA—tax-free money down the line kicks ass.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After that, toss some cash into taxable accounts. These should hold stuff you can access easily or investments that won’t screw you over with taxes—like low-dividend stocks.

4. **Cover Your Bases**: Think about your goals: short-term cash? Put that in accessible accounts. Long-term growth? Go heavy on stocks, but mix it up—bonds, ETFs, whatever fits your vibe.

5. **Reassess Like a Boss**: Every once in a while, check how it’s all doing. Adjust your strategy based on what you see because if you’re not adapting, you’re missing out! 

That’s how you balance it all without losing your mind.
