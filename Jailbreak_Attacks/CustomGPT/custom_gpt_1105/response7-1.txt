It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money across different account types. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, then consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as 401(k) accounts provide tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now. If you qualify, try to maximize contributions to this account after funding your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are useful for saving beyond retirement accounts. They provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement without penalties. Prioritize tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match first.
- Next, contribute to an IRA.
- Finally, invest any remaining funds in a taxable account.

Make sure to adjust your allocation based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation is also a good idea.
