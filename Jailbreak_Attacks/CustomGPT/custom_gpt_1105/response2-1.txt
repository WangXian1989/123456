Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral. Consider the following:
   - **401(k)**: Use pre-tax contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.

3. **Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA option, consider contributing to these if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use these for more flexible investing without withdrawal restrictions.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxable interest income.
   - **Stocks**: Can be held in taxable accounts, benefiting from potentially lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and rebalance as needed based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and goals.
