Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if your income allows it, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Keep investments in these accounts that will generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks may be better in tax-advantaged accounts due to potentially high growth, while safer investments like bonds can be placed in taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of total contributions for employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (current limit is $6,500 per year; $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Considerations
- Reassess your distribution regularly, especially as your income or investment goals change.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This balanced approach helps maximize tax benefits while aligning with your investment goals.
