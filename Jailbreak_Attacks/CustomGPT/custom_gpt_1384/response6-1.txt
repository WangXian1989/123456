To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After optimizing your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This is beneficial for liquidity and flexibility, as you can access these funds without penalties.

3. **Balance Your Risk and Investment Goals**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all account types to mitigate risks.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Keep in mind the order in which you might withdraw money in retirement, as this can affect your tax situation. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment distribution and make adjustments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for both growth potential and tax efficiency.
