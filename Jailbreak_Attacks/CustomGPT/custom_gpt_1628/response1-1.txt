Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth accounts offer tax-free growth, while Traditional gives you tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or additional investments, as they provide flexibility and can hold various assets. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type and plan withdrawals accordingly.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
