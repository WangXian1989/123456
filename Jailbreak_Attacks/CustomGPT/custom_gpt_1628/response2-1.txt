Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Prioritize these if your 401(k) is fully funded and you want additional tax advantages.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - For short-term goals or immediate access, use taxable accounts.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment goals, diversifying across asset classes within your accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals from each account type may affect your tax situation in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation as needed to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique situation.
