Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility, contribute to an IRA for tax advantages. Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Diversification**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications (like index funds or municipal bonds).

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep some cash in a taxable account for liquidity, ensuring you have access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Long-Term Focus**
   - Prioritize longer-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compound growth.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Getting personalized advice can be beneficial for complex situations or to align strategies with your specific goals.

By balancing these considerations, you'll create a well-rounded investment strategy tailored to your needs.
