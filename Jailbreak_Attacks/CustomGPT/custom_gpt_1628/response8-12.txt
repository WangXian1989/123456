I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and sugars; include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treat conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or fatty liver disease as needed.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
