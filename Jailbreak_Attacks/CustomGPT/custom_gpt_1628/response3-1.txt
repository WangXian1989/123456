Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth and often employer matching. Higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth), with lower contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access, but you pay capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free" money.
   - **Consider IRAs:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred benefits.

### 3. **Adjust for Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Focus on investments that you expect to grow significantly, keeping taxes deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that yield lower returns or are tax-efficient, like index funds or stocks with low turnover.

### 4. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time frame for each account. Longer-term goals might lean more toward growth investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Guidance:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
