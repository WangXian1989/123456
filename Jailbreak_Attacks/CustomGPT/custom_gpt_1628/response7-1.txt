To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: For higher contribution limits and possible employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement age, as they don't have withdrawal penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals and situation. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your long-term growth and tax efficiency.
