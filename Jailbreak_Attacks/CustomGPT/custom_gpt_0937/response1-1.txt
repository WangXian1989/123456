Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider IRAs for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs offer tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRAs**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income rates; long-term gains benefit from lower rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place more stable investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep high-growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of long-term capital gains treatment.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation yearly or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### General Recommendations
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, then max out your IRA. After that, direct additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your immediate needs and tax strategy.

By following these guidelines and adjusting as your circumstances change, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your money.
