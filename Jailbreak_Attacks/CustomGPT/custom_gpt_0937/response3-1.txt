Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts. The limits for these accounts may change annually, so stay updated.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - A traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth, and you should consider whether you will benefit more from tax savings now or later.

4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Each account type could have different investment allocations (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level. This is important as market conditions change and over time can affect your portfolio's performance.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Think about when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity without penalties, while retirement accounts have age restrictions for withdrawals.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement, buying a home, or funding education. Each account can play a role in these goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex or if you’re unsure about your investment strategy.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize your growth potential while managing your tax liability effectively.
