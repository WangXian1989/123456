Investing strategically across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and reduce tax burdens. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Priority:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be the first step.
   - **Contribution Rate:** Aim for at least 10-15% if adequately funded.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Types:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax deductibility.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Use:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for both short- and long-term savings.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on index funds or ETFs, as they have lower turnover and are generally more tax-efficient.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon:** Adjust your investments based on how long you have until retirement and your comfort with risk.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target allocation.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Bracket Awareness:** Be mindful of your tax bracket when withdrawing from these accounts.
   - **Withdrawals:** Consider the order of withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions up to match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute as much as you can after 401(k).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Fund these with remaining savings.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax status.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across these account types to build a robust retirement plan.
