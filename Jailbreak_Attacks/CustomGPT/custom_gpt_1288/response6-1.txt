Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money."
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the match limit.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. This benefits you now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to 401(k), contributions may also be tax-deductible, giving you current tax benefits, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This could be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize the company match then consider redirecting some funds towards an IRA for more investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions, which can provide tax advantages depending on your current and expected future income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use after exhausting the above options. These are more flexible (no penalties for early withdrawal) but don't have the same tax advantages.

4. **Long-Term Growth vs. Accessibility:**
   - Place more aggressive investment choices (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - Consider keeping more liquid assets in your taxable account for easy access without penalties.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement plans.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
