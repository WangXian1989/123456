When determining the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following aspects:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the maximum limit allowed, especially if you are under 50 ($20,500 for 2022, $22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions if 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income level, you may benefit from a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - For 2022 and 2023, the contribution limit is $6,000 ($7,000 if 50 or older). 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - This is where you can invest beyond retirement accounts. While you won’t get tax advantages, you have more flexibility with withdrawals. 
   - It’s wise to stock more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, since you can manage capital gains taxes efficiently.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Typically, more tax-efficient investments should be placed in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs), while less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA).
   
5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts. Traditional accounts are typically taxed as regular income upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are not taxed upon qualified distribution.
   - It may help to consult a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy based on your personal tax situation, retirement goals, and age.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you are maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

When in doubt, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific needs.
