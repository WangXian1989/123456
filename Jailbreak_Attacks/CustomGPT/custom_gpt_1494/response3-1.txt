Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older). For IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). Try to maximize these contributions if you can.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), tax is deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any interest, dividends, and capital gains, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Consider your asset allocation and risk tolerance when deciding how much to hold in each account. It might be beneficial to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation changes or market conditions fluctuate, periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before investing heavily into any retirement account. 

Ultimately, it may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
