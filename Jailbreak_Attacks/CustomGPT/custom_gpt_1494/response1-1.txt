The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and current age. Hereâ€™s a simple approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, putting money in a Roth IRA can be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. This account allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity. Use this account for goals like buying a house or other short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This helps manage risk.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly revisit your allocations to adjust based on changing financial circumstances and market conditions.

It might be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a detailed strategy based on your personal situation! Need help finding one?
