1. **Social Media Engagement**: Use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat where young people spend a lot of their time. Create engaging content that resonates with their values and interests.

2. **Authentic Messaging**: Speak to issues that matter to young voters, such as climate change, education, and job opportunities. Use genuine voices and relatable messages.

3. **Interactive Campaigns**: Host events, town halls, or virtual discussions that allow for direct interaction. Encourage participation through polls, Q&A sessions, and opportunities to express their views.
