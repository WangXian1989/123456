To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these ideas:

  

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional or Roth IRAs can offer tax advantages, depending on your situation. If you're eligible, Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. They can provide more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties and give you access to funds for short-term goals.
