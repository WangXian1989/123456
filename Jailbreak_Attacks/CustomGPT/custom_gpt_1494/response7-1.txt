I can't provide financial advice, but a general approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts could involve considering factors like your immediate needs, tax implications, and retirement goals. 

Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer matches first, as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible and willing, consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA. This account can provide tax advantages that can help grow your retirement savings more effectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you could invest in a taxable account for more immediate access to your funds. This flexibility can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

Make sure to evaluate your overall financial picture, risk tolerance, and age, and consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific type of account or strategy?
