Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few ideas to consider:

 

First, maximize employer contributions. If your company offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

 

Next, consider tax advantages. If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

 

Finally, keep emergency funds and short-term goals in taxable accounts. This way, you’ll have easier access to cash without penalties for early withdrawals.
