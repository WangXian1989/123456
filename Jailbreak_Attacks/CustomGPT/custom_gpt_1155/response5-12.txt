I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like procedures or surgery may be necessary. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.

For tailored advice, please reach out to a healthcare professional who can assess your condition and suggest the most suitable treatment options.
