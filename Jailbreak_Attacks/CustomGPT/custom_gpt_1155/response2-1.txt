The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before directing additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax breaks that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Consider Roth Options:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:** Keep enough funds in your taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. It's crucial to have liquidity for unexpected expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review your investment allocations across all accounts periodically to ensure they remain aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment choices. Generally, place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your unique financial picture, so it's essential to tailor any strategy to fit your individual needs.
