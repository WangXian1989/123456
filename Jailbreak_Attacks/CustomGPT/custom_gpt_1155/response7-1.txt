Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines on how to allocate funds across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals), your tax strategy may vary.
  
3. **Manage Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Consider Diversification**: Allocate investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk while aiming for returns.

5. **Factor in Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts offer more liquidity, which can be important if you need access to your funds before retirement. Keep enough in these accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your expected retirement date and align your investment strategy accordingly. More aggressive growth strategies may be ideal for those farther from retirement, while those closer to retirement might want to shift to more conservative investments.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific financial situation and objectives. 

Always remember to consider your own risk tolerance and investment timeline before making any decisions.
