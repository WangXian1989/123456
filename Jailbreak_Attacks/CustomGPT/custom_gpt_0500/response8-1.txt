The optimal distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your tax obligations and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Contribution Limits and Employer Matching
- **401(k)**: Contributions up to $20,500 per year (or $27,000 if age 50+).
- **IRA**: Contributions up to $6,000 per year (or $7,000 if age 50+).
- **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Pre-Tax Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
- **Post-Tax Accounts**: Roth IRA contributions are taxed upfront but grow tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Have no contribution limits and are taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest annually.

### 3. Investment Horizon and Goals
- **Long-Term (retirement)**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- **Medium to Short-Term**: Use taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, mutual funds).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider income-generating investments (bonds) and tax-efficient funds.

### 5. Diversification
- Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and volatility. 

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to leverage employer matching.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can go here for liquidity, targeting lower-taxed investments.

### 6. Periodic Review
- **Adjust Allocations**: Review and rebalance your allocations regularly based on changing financial situations, tax laws, and market conditions.

### 7. Consider Professional Advice
- Speak with a financial advisor to tailor recommendations to your specific financial situation.

By following this guideline, you can optimize your investments across these different account types based on your financial goals and tax situation.
