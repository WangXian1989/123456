Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors specific to your financial situation and goals. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you make informed decisions:

### Factors to Consider:
1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon selling assets. Interest and dividends are also taxable in the year received.

2. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Funds in retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can often be invested more aggressively since they are earmarked for long-term growth.
   - If you need liquidity in the short to medium term, prioritize taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Ensure you maximize employer matching in your 401(k) if available, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks. Different accounts can hold various assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as it is the best immediate return on investment.

- **Focus on 401(k) and IRA for Retirement Savings**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible) to benefit from tax-free growth.

- **Tackle Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use any excess funds for your taxable accounts, focusing on long-term capital gains investments to minimize taxes.

### Example Based on Hypothetical Income:
1. **Salary**: $100,000
2. **401(k) Match**: 5% employer match
3. **Contributions**:
   - Contribute 5% to 401(k) = $5,000 (get $2,500 match)
   - Contribute $6,500 to IRA
   - Remaining funds can be placed in taxable accounts based on your financial goals.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance, tax changes, and shifts in financial goals to optimize your strategy.

### Final Thought:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution plan based on specific needs and market conditions.
