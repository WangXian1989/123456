Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: Consider contributing up to the maximum limit (for 2023, $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deductible contributions, which could be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for funds you may need before retirement age or for investing that does not fit in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have at least 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a readily accessible account.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) contributions first, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance or changes in your financial situation.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and how close you are to retirement should influence your investment choices. Younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative investments.
- **Tax Implications**: Take into account your current and expected future tax brackets. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as income.

### Consult a Professional:
Given that every situation is unique, it’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal financial situation.
