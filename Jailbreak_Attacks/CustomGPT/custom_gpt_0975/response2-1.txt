Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.
   
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, also contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals (if eligible). 

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting extra funds into a taxable account. This offers greater flexibility for withdrawals but comes with capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean towards more stocks.
   
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you have more investment choices here. Consider using tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.
   
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or after-tax investments. Tax-efficient funds and strategies (like tax-loss harvesting) can help mitigate tax impacts.

4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. 
   - Develop a withdrawal strategy for retirement that minimizes taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy that fits your individual needs.

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and flexibility in your investment strategy.
