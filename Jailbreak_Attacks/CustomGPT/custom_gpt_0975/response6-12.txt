I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Here are some general approaches based on common liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and overall health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Stay away from substances that can damage the liver, such as alcohol, certain medications, and illicit drugs.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Checkups**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health and detect any worsening conditions.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, procedures or liver transplants might be considered.

Again, please consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice based on your specific condition.
