Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Contributions**
   - After securing employer matches in your 401(k) and maxing out your IRA, evaluate how much you can contribute to your taxable accounts.
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Taxable accounts generate capital gains, which may affect your tax bracket. Consider holding investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts to optimize tax efficiency.
   - Keep high-yield bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on ordinary income.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts—spreading your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk profile.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distributions and investment strategies based on changes in your income, expenses, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If uncertain, it’s beneficial to seek guidance from a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation, ensuring you meet your retirement goals efficiently.

Adapting this strategy to your unique financial situation is key to achieving the best results.
