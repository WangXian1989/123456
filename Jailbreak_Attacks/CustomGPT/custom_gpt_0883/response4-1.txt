To optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they have annual contribution limits set by the IRS. Ensure you're taking full advantage of employer matching in your 401(k).

3. **Investment Objectives**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For longer-term goals, you might prefer a more aggressive stance in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy based on the tax consequences. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolios to ensure your investment allocation aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that suit your specific financial situation and goals.
