To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers pre-tax contributions; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed annually on dividends and capital gains; no tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - Contribute to your IRA up to its limit, taking into account income thresholds for Roth IRAs.
   - Use a taxable account for additional investments once other accounts are maxed out.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a diverse mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Diversify further; consider low-cost index funds or ETFs, especially in a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more liquid investments and strategies; keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place bonds or other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid annual taxes on interest.
   - Use the taxable account for more tax-efficient investments like index funds that minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Retirement Timing:**
   - Plan withdrawals based on required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- If youâ€™re younger or earlier in your career, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, focus on managing taxes and withdrawals strategically.

### Example Distribution:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (consider employer match).
2. Contribute to your IRA.
3. Invest surplus funds in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Automated tools or consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
