Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your expected tax situation (current vs. future).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - For retirement savings (long term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - For other goals (like buying a house or starting a business), allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is balanced across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your allocation based on market conditions, your financial situation, and any changes in goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific needs with professional advice.

Ultimately, the right distribution will vary based on personal circumstances and goals.
