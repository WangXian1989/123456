To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Determine how much you'll need for retirement and the timeline.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Identify any upcoming financial needs that might require liquidity.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out for employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax, but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks, Bonds, and Cash:** Allocate across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford more risk (e.g., more stocks).
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing goals.

### 4. **Contribution Limits and Strategy**
   - **Max Out Accounts:** If possible, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA annually.
   - **Backdoor Roth IRA:** If you're in a high-income bracket, consider this strategy to fund a Roth IRA indirectly.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you'll withdraw from each account based on tax implications and your income needs.
   - Typically, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Summary
- Start by maxing out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k).
- Consider the tax advantages of IRAs and utilize a taxable account for additional flexibility.
- Regularly review your investments and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.

This approach can help you optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency over time.
