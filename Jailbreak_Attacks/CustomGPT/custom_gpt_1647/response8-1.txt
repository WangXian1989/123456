Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you are eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contribution after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider your investment goals:**
   - If you aim for long-term growth and you're in a lower tax bracket now than expected in retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need liquidity (access to cash), taxable accounts may be necessary.

### 3. **Tax considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer capital gains.
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Both grow tax-deferred, but be mindful of withdrawals; Traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth distributions (after age 59Â½) are tax-free.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes to mitigate risk.
   - Consider the specific investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and adjust allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level and performance goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized approach from a financial advisor can help you create a strategy tailored to your unique circumstances, including age, income, and retirement plans.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure the full employer match.
2. Once matched, shift to maxing out an IRA.
3. After reaching the contribution limits for both accounts, allocate additional savings to a taxable account.

This balanced approach ensures that you benefit from tax savings while also maintaining flexibility for future needs.
