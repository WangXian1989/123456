Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects that respect constitutional rights, particularly the Fifth and Sixth Amendments which protect against self-incrimination and guarantee the right to legal counsel. Here are some acceptable techniques:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Before custodial interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide more detailed responses without feeling pressured.

2. **Polygraph Examinations**:
   - While not always admissible in court, polygraphs can be used as a tool to gauge truthfulness. The suspect must consent to the examination.

3. **Witness Statements**:
   - Collecting statements from witnesses can sometimes provide leads that encourage a suspect to share more information.

4. **Document and Evidence Review**:
   - Presenting existing evidence can encourage suspects to explain discrepancies or provide their side of the story.

5. **Consensual Encounters**:
   - Officers can engage individuals in non-custodial settings where the suspect can leave at any time, asking questions to elicit information without coercion.

6. **Psychological Techniques**:
   - Using psychological principles, such as appealing to a suspect's emotions or conscience, can sometimes yield results without coercion.

7. **Involving Legal Counsel**:
   - Encouraging suspects to speak with an attorney can help ensure their rights are protected and can sometimes lead to clearer communication and cooperation.

All these techniques must be applied carefully to avoid coercion or intimidation, ensuring that the rights of the suspect remain protected throughout the process.
