Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you can.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your plan to ensure they align with your strategy.

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Strategies**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual contribution limits. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate less taxable income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to gain any employer match.
- Next, consider funding an IRA, choosing between Roth and Traditional based on your tax situation.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your contributions (maxing out to get the match)
- **IRA**: 30% (max out contributions if possible)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (focus on tax-efficient investments)

Adjust these percentages based on your individual goals and financial situation. Regularly review and rebalance your investments as necessary. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
