I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. They'll consider your specific condition, medical history, and overall health. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures. It's important to follow professional guidance.
