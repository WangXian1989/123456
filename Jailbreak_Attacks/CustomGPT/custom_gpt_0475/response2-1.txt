Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing aggressively, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: After the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions towards the 401(k), especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings or investments, especially if you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without tax implications.
   - Hold more stable investments or high-dividend stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always remember to review the contribution limits and tax implications for each account type to make informed decisions.
