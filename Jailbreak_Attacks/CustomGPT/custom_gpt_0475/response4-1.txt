It's important to consider a variety of factors when distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general principles to help guide your decisions:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions often lower your taxable income, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Consider your short-term and long-term goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that offer before contributing to an IRA or taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - High-growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains. 
   - Bonds or income-generating assets may be better held in taxable accounts where the tax impact can be managed better.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement to optimize tax efficiency. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start with maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of employer matches.
- Then, consider maxing out an IRA (or Roth IRA if you're eligible) for additional tax advantages.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts based on your immediate financial needs and investment strategy.

### Annual Review:
Review and adjust your distribution regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies is also recommended.
