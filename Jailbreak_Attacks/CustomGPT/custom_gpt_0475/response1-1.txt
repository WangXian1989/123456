To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, but withdrawals are taxed.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually has limited investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility in investment choices. You can invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, and more.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that are likely to generate tax-efficient income, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. A common target is 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, place riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on higher returns.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep higher-yielding assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your investments periodically and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.
