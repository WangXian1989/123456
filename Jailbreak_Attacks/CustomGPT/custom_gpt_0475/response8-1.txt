Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, especially if they are held long-term. Be mindful of the tax implications of selling assets in these accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower tax rates (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings for emergencies before maximizing retirement account contributions.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your investment horizon.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. This will ensure you're making informed decisions aligned with your long-term financial objectives.
