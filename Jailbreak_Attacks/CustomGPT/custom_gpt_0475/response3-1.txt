Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you may need in the short term or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) for assets that will generate higher growth (like equities), since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Hold more interest-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens, since interest income is taxed at ordinary rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

Adjust the approach based on your retirement timeline, tax bracket, and investment preferences.
