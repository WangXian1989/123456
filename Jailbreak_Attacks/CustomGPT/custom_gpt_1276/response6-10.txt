Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage open communication.
   - **Active Listening**: Showing genuine interest in what the suspect has to say to create a trusting environment.

2. **Interrogation Strategies**:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recount events in detail, often increasing recall.
   - **Reid Technique**: A structured approach that includes behavior analysis and strategic questioning without coercion.

3. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Recording Interrogations**: Ensuring transparency and preserving the integrity of the interrogation process.
   - **Data Analysis Tools**: Utilizing technology to analyze behaviors and identify potential areas for questioning.

4. **Legal Standards**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights before questioning to ensure any information gathered is admissible in court.
   - **Informed Consent**: Seeking voluntary consent for interviews and searches to respect constitutional protections.

These methods focus on cooperation and respect for rights, ultimately leading to more credible and usable information.
