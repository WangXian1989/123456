To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments. They can be beneficial for liquidity needs and capital gains taxes are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Place equities in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth can compound tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Investments**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts, where you might be taxed at a lower rate on capital gains rather than ordinary income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan when to access funds from each account to minimize tax burdens in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
