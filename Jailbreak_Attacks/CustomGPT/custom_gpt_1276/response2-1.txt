Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Assess Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After getting the employer match, try to max out contributions to your IRA (whether Traditional or Roth).
   - In 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 4. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**
   - Once you've maxed out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you more flexibility for early withdrawals and can be used for shorter-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your investment mix according to your changing risk tolerance and market conditions. 

### 7. **Consider Your Timeline and Goals**
   - Short-term goals may necessitate more liquid, lower-risk investments, while long-term goals can favor growth-oriented investments.

### Summary
1. Maximize your 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth).
3. Continue contributing to your 401(k).
4. Use taxable accounts for additional investments based on your needs.
5. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.
