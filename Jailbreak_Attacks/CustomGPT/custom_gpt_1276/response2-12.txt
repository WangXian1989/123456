1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, sugar, and salt)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease
   - Other specific medications depending on the condition

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests
   - Imaging studies to monitor liver health

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: 
   - Supplements and vitamins may be recommended, especially for those with malnutrition.

It's crucial to receive personalized guidance from your healthcare provider based on your specific diagnosis and health status.
