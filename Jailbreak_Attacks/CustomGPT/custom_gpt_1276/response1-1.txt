When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions. Prioritize maximizing this to get the "free money." Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, impacting your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these accounts don’t offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility. They're good for investments you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If your focus is long-term (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have medium-term goals, a taxable account can be useful.
  
3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. Funds in 401(k) and IRA are less accessible if you need cash quickly.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each type of account. Maximize 401(k) contributions and consider IRAs afterwards.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be kept in tax-advantaged accounts, whereas more stable investments (like bonds) might be suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can help optimize your entire financial strategy, especially considering changing tax laws and personal circumstances.

A general approach could be:
1. Max out your 401(k) up to any employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA if it offers deductions.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments based on your goals and needs.

This structure provides a balance of tax efficiency, growth potential, and access to funds.
