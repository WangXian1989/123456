To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferment. Conversely, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. You can maintain a different asset allocation in each account but need to look at them as a whole.

5. **Withdrawals Planning**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Keep track of your investment performance and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain about the best distribution for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.

This distribution approach can help you optimize your investments for growth while minimizing your tax liabilities over time.
