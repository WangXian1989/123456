I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems can vary greatly depending on the specific condition and severity of your liver disease. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often involves dietary changes, exercise, and weight loss if necessary. Reducing alcohol intake is also critical.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications might be prescribed to manage conditions such as hepatitis or to combat inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments may be essential to monitor liver function and check for any progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical options might be necessary, especially for tumors or severe cirrhosis.

5. **Liver Transplant**: This could be an option for those with end-stage liver disease.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized recommendations based on your health status.
