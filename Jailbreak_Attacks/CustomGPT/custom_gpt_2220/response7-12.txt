I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.
  
2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to address the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of liver function through blood tests may be necessary to track the progression of the condition and the effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgical interventions may be required, including liver transplantation.

5. **Support Groups:** Joining a support group for individuals with liver disease can provide emotional support and helpful resources.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your situation.
