Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's free money!
   - **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that produce less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Use tax-efficient strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate risk according to your age and retirement timeline. Younger investors typically take on more risk, while those closer to retirement might want to be more conservative.
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Revisit and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals, especially after significant market movements.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're uncertain about the best approach for your specific situation, a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy.

Ultimately, the right distribution is highly personal, so consider your individual circumstances and how they align with your financial goals.
