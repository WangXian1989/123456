Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Balance Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds here for short-term needs or to manage your capital gains more effectively, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Invest in more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or lessen taxes on higher returns.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where tax rates on interest can be high.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
