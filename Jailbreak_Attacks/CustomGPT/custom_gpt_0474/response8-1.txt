Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The advantages include tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you need a tax deduction now, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties for withdrawals before retirement age.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes can impact your returns.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
