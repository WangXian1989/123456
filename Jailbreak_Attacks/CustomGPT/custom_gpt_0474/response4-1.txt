Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (and employer match), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs have tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Balance Contributions:**
   - **Target Contributions:** Depending on your income and tax bracket, you might want to balance contributions between 401(k) and IRA to optimize tax efficiencies.

3. **Consider Taxation on Withdrawals:**
   - Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals since they allow for more flexibility and potentially lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

4. **Diversification of Assets:**
   - Distribute different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all three account types to ensure diversification and manage risk effectively.

5. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategies:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly rebalance your assets across accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, or market conditions.

By planning thoughtfully and considering these strategies, you can work towards effectively distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial objectives. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
