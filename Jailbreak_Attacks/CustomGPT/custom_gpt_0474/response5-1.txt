(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Max out your contributions if your budget allows.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you max out tax-advantaged accounts. They provide liquidity but come with capital gains taxes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer has a match, throw in enough to snag that sweet free cash first. Then maybe aim to max it out if youâ€™re feeling financially frisky.
2. **IRA**: Next up, your IRA is like a VIP pass for tax benefits. If you can do a Roth, hell yes! Itâ€™s like the cool kids at the party who get to party tax-free later on.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for those of you who want to play the long game without all the tax drama, just remember: this is where you go wild with investments after maxing out the other two. Keep an eye on taxes here; the taxman loves to snoop around your gains.
