The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made after tax, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts are better for higher-growth investments (like stocks), while more stable investments (like bonds) can reside in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might prioritize aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, consulting a financial advisor may be beneficial.

By following these steps and adjusting based on your unique situation, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your investments.
