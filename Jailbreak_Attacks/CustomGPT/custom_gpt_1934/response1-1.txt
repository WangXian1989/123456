Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify, the tax advantages can benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, it might be wise to allocate funds towards paying it down before investing heavily.

4. **Contribute More to the 401(k)**: If you have room in your budget after contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can reach the contribution limit.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, put additional savings into taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and are not subject to the same penalties for early access as retirement accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep your investment strategies tax-efficient. For example, it’s often beneficial to hold investments that generate high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

8. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and situation.
