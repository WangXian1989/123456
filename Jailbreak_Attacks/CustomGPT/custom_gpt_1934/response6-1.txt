Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit), contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Prioritize Account Types Based on Taxation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**:
     - Ideal for long-term growth since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - Great for individuals in a higher tax bracket now who expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Flexibility for withdrawals and potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
     - Suitable for shorter-term goals or if you expect to face higher tax brackets in the future.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify investments appropriately across accounts. 
   - **Bond vs. Stock Allocation**: Typically, consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxes.

### 4. **Adjust for Future Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of withdrawal strategies in retirement to minimize taxes. 
   - Analyze potential Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts that begin at age 73.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually or during significant life changes.
   - Rebalance as needed to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, prioritize investments based on tax implications, and regularly monitor and adjust your strategy. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
