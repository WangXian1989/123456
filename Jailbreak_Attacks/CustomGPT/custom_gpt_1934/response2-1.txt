To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k):** Focus on diversified investments offered within your plan, such as target-date funds or index funds.
   - **IRA:** Choose investments that fit your risk tolerance and investment goals. You may have more options here compared to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as they will be taxed differently than income.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** No taxes on qualified withdrawals, making this a good option for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Pay attention to capital gains taxes, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before fully funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

### 5. **Adjust for Time Horizon and Goals**
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize reducing risk in your 401(k) and IRA. If you're younger, consider higher growth options in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing needs.

### Conclusion
By maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, diversifying your investments, considering tax implications, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your distribution of funds across these accounts effectively.
