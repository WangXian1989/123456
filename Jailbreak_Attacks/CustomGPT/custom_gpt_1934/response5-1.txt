Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate taxable income (like dividends or short-term capital gains), especially if you're not in the highest tax bracket. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed lower than ordinary income.

### 3. **Balance Your Risk Tolerance and Growth Needs**:
   - Allocate more to riskier assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
3. Invest in a diversified portfolio within taxable accounts based on cash flow needs and expenses.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
