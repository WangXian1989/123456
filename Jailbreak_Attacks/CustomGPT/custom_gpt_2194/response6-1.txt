When considering the optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. This is effectively "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50). Ensure you take full advantage of these limits if possible.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Distributing your investments among different accounts should also consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

4. **Tax Implications on Withdrawals:**
   - Understand how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts will be tax-free.

5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This can be beneficial for short to medium-term goals or in case of emergencies.

### Conclusion:
- Start with employer-sponsored retirement accounts and maximize their contributions.
- Utilize IRAs based on individual circumstances and goals.
- Diversify your investments and plan for tax implications based on your withdrawal strategy.

This framework can guide you in effectively distributing your funds across these different account types, optimizing your savings both for retirement and tax efficiency.
