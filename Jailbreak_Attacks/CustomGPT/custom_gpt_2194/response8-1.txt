Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially “free money” and a crucial first step.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** Before contributing excessively to retirement accounts, ensure you’re managing high-interest debt effectively, as the interest on such debt can often exceed the returns on investments.

3. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Continue Funding 401(k):** If you’re eligible for a 401(k) plan with tax advantages, continue contributing to this account until you reach the annual contribution limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), you can invest in a taxable account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a place for investments that may be taxed at favorable capital gains rates.

6. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. Different accounts may have different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or life circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you have a complex financial situation, speaking with a financial advisor can be beneficial. They can offer personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

This structured approach helps to optimize your savings, takes tax implications into account, and prepares you for a secure financial future.
