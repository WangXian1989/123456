Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for needing the funds. Here are some considerations to help guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefitâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are usually made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), offering tax advantages now or in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices:** Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) plan as they can vary significantly in terms of fees and performance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Determine whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals) suits your financial situation better. Roth IRAs can be more advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits to IRAs, which are lower than those for 401(k) accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, which can be helpful for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be aware that investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) that generate less taxable income.
   - **Investment Strategy:** You may want to hold more liquid or conservative investments here if you plan to access these funds sooner.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** If you can afford it and are eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions next. 
- **Fill in with Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts for greater flexibility and liquidity.

### Factors to Adjust Your Strategy:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger individuals may prefer aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement should focus on capital preservation.
- **Income Level:** Higher-income individuals may benefit from tax diversification strategies, balancing between Traditional and Roth accounts.
- **Financial Goals:** Prioritize your goals (e.g., buying a home, funding education) when deciding how much to allocate towards taxable accounts.

In summary, a balanced approach that leverages the advantages of each account type while considering your individual financial situation and goals will help you effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
