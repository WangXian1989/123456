To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Try to max out your contribution limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, especially consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions. 

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding investments like bonds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type. Balance your risk based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your tax burden.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and performance in each account. As you approach retirement, you may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial goals.
