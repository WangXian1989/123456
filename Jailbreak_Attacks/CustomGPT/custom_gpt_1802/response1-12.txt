   - Medications to control other underlying conditions (like diabetes or high cholesterol).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds) to assess liver health.

4. **Management of Complications**: 
   - Treatments for complications like ascites (fluid buildup) or portal hypertension.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Supportive Therapies**:
