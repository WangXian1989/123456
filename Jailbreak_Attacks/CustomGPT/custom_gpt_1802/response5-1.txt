Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy considering your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this—it's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer's plan offers good investment options with low fees. The tax deferral benefits can be significant.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current income level and expected future tax rate.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when deciding on asset allocation (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly based on market performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
