Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and individual circumstances. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These can be more flexible if you need access to your money before retirement, but keep in mind that you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk and enhance growth potential.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan that considers your specific circumstances and goals.
