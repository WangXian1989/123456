When determining how to allocate your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employers may match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Determine whether you are investing for short-term or long-term goals. Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while retirement savings should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially to take advantage of any employer match) before funding your IRA.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Long-term investments in retirement accounts can afford more risk due to the time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, providing more flexibility for emergencies or early retirement needs.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Fund IRA Next**: Max out contributions to your Roth or Traditional IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Return to 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use leftover funds for taxable accounts for flexibility and as a source for short-term goals.
