Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. However, interest and dividends are taxed annually.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account before investing excess funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. Consider risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market changes.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personal circumstances and guidelines, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while considering your tax situation and future needs.
