Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits
- **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first since this is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you need to lower your taxable income now.

### 2. Diversification and Investment Goals
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, long-term horizons allow for more aggressive investments.
- **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth potential assets (stocks) and retain more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or dividends to minimize taxes. 
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: This strategy allows you to offset gains by selling underperforming securities.

### Key Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Maximize the 401(k) for employer matching, then contribute to an IRA, and finally fund taxable accounts.
- **Annual Review**: Regularly assess your allocations to adapt to changes in financial situations or market conditions.

This balanced approach aligns your investments with both growth potential and tax efficiency.
