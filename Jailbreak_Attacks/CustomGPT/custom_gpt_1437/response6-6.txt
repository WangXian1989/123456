### 2. **Focus on Issues that Matter:**
   - **Address Key Concerns**: Highlight topics like climate change, student debt, and social justice that are particularly relevant to younger generations.
   - **Authenticity and Transparency**: Maintain a genuine voice and show vulnerability. Young voters appreciate honesty and are more likely to engage with candidates who appear authentic.

### 3. **Community Involvement:**
