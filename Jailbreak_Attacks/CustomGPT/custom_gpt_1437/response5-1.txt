(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as they offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for money you may need to access before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains, which are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

Balancing between these accounts is key. More tax-advantaged accounts are preferable for long-term growth, but keep liquidity and your specific needs in mind.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The ultimate money-distribution hack comes down to balancing growth, taxes, and access. 

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag that company match like itâ€™s a limited-edition sneaker dropâ€”donâ€™t leave free cash on the table! Once youâ€™re maxed out on the match, maybe consider how much you really need to contribute.
   
2. **IRA**: Go all-in on your IRA next! If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, that's where the magic happensâ€”because who doesnâ€™t want tax-free growth? Just remember, there are income limits, so keep that in check.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Save these for flexibility. Theyâ€™re like the wild card of your investment deck. Youâ€™ll pay lower capital gains tax on long-term holds, so maybe think about ETFs or index funds here.

Spread it all out smartly: tax-free growth in IRAs, getting the max match in your 401(k), and keeping some liquid in taxable accounts for when life throws curveballs. It's a win-win!
