Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this—it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments you may want to access without penalties. They can also be a place for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Pay attention to the fees associated with each account type and investment option, as they can eat into your returns over time.

When in doubt, consulting a financial advisor can tailor strategies to your personal situation.
