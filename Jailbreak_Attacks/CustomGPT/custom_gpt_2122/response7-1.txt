Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For instance, contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match is a great starting point, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider focusing on a traditional or Roth IRA, as both offer tax benefits that can enhance your retirement savings. 

When it comes to taxable accounts, they can be useful for goals that are shorter-term or outside of retirement. The investment strategy may differ here since you will be liable for taxes on dividends and capital gains. It might be beneficial to place investments with high expected growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments or those generating income could be held in taxable accounts. Itâ€™s crucial to reassess your portfolio periodically and consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution based on your specific circumstances and market conditions.

Before taking action, consider your current tax bracket, retirement goals, and whether you expect your income to change in the future. This comprehensive approach will help ensure that your money is distributed in a way that aligns with your long-term financial plans while maximizing tax efficiency.
