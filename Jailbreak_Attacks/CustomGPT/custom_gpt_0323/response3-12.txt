Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Stop or limit alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, treatments like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition.
