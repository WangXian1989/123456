To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to at least get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Ideal for tax deductions if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Better if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later; contributions grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use for short-term needs and investments that generate capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified, long-term growth investments; often has limited options.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment choices; consider more volatile assets for growth, given the longer investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments that generate lower taxable gains (e.g., index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Personal Financial Goals**
   - Assess your retirement horizon, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs to inform distribution decisions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### **Conclusion**
A balanced portfolio may require adjusting contributions yearly based on performance and personal circumstances. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
