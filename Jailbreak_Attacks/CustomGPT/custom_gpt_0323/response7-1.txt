Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income, tax situation, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Choose a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Max out your IRA contributions up to the limit.

3. **Taxable accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you max out retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.

5. **Rebalance regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
