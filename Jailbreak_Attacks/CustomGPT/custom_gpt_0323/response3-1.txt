Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Both 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferral benefits. Prioritize these for higher-income years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of funds suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments with high growth potential, given that they can grow tax-free (if Roth) or tax-deferred (if traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as they are easier to access without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy based on your individual circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
