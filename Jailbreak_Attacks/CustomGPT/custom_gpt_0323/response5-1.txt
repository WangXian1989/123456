Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Funds grow tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Ideal for those in higher tax brackets now.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for funds you may need before retirement age, though interest and dividends are taxable.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, potentially using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts more time to grow.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay on track with your goals.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
