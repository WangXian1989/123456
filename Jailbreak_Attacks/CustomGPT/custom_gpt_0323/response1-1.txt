Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth until retirement. Contribute up to the limit.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred; consider this if you can’t contribute more to your 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Ideal for investment growth that's taxed at lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk, taking advantage of the different tax treatments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about where to draw funds from in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s best to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy for your specific situation.
