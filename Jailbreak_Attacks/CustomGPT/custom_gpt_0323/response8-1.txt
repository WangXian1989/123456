To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - If possible, max out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) contributions next.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term needs or to maintain liquidity. Be aware of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks).
   - Consider more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact from capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on performance, goals, or changing risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing growth potential with tax efficiency, you can create a more robust retirement strategy.
