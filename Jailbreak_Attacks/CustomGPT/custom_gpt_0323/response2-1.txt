To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now. Good for higher earners who want to lower current tax bills.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect higher taxes in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for money you may need before retirement. Investments here can be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where they benefit from deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income regularly, such as bonds, to avoid high tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation across accounts, maintaining diversity in asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Think about when youâ€™ll need access to each account type, since different accounts have different rules and penalties for withdrawals.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute more if you're in a high tax bracket.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions, focusing on Roth if you qualify.
3. **Taxable**: Invest surplus income here, focusing on tax-efficient funds.
