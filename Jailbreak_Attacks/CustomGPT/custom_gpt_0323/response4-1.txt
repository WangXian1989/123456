Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Traditional Accounts:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be advantageous if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Keep money for short-term goals or emergencies in taxable accounts, as they can provide easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) that generate income taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your allocations based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (up to the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contribution ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds for additional investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor this distribution based on your specific financial situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
