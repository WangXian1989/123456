The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions to traditional 401(k) plans are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be beneficial. Contributions to a traditional IRA may also provide tax deductions, depending on your income and participation in an employer plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts are beneficial for investing in assets that may generate a lower tax rate, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Consider the order in which you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it is advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as needed to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
