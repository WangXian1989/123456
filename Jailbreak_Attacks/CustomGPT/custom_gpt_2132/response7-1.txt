When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you create a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contributing to an IRA can also provide tax advantages, depending on whether you choose a Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) might be beneficial, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions that can be beneficial.

3. **Balance Risk and Investment Choices:**
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) plan, as these may vary significantly between employers. Diversify within those options to maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Allocate your equity and bond holdings based on your age and risk tolerance. A common rule is to subtract your age from 100 (or 110) to determine the percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable brokerage account. This offers greater liquidity and flexibility, as you can access the funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Keep in mind tax implications on gains, dividends, and interest earned in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Your Strategy Annually:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals to ensure that your distribution aligns with changes in your personal circumstances or market conditions.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution of your money among these accounts depends on your unique financial landscape and retirement goals.
