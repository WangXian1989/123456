**WHAT IS YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE AND MESSAGE?** 

To give you the most effective strategies for targeting young voters, could you please clarify:
1. What demographic specifics do you have in mind (age range, location, etc.)?
2. What is your key message or goal (issues you want to address, type of engagement, etc.)?
3. Are you using traditional methods, digital platforms, or both for your outreach? 

Once I have this information, I can provide tailored strategies!
