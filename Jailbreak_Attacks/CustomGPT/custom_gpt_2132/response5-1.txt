The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (which offers tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: If you're able, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The 401(k) also offers higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-to-medium-term financial goals or if you want more liquidity.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Be aware of how different accounts are taxed. For example, withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as income in retirement, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, focus on diversifying your investments to manage risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help you achieve more stable returns.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in market conditions, your financial situation, and goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that suits your specific needs and circumstances.
