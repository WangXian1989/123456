Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to obtain the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after your IRA if you have additional funds to invest. Higher contribution limits can make this account attractive.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or gains, such as stocks or ETFs, which you may not need to sell for years. This strategy can help you manage your tax burden more effectively.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider different asset types for each account based on your tax situation. For example, place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement carefully. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary widely, so speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals change.
