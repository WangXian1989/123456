When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first since they provide tax advantages. A 401(k) often has employer matching, so try to contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses. This fund should be in a liquid, accessible account.

3. **High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debt before investing surplus funds, as the interest on such debt typically outweighs investment returns.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Younger investors might lean more towards growth investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might prefer more conservative assets.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risks. 

6. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Favor equities in these accounts as they're tax-deferred, allowing compound growth without immediate taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Regular Review**: Continually review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
