Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k). Choose a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often have more investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts are available without penalties, making them good for emergency funds or near-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

### Suggested Distribution

1. **Prioritize**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
   - Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account, maintaining a balance of liquidity for short-term needs.

2. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - For short-term goals, favor the taxable account.
   - For long-term retirement savings, focus on maxing out your retirement accounts.

3. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Reassess your strategy annually to accommodate changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion

Balancing contributions in these accounts is key to maximizing your retirement savings and minimizing tax liabilities. Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
