When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, current age, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Generally, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if your employer matches contributions. The investment options may be limited, so consider your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **IRA Options**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This may allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but remember that investment gains will be subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider asset allocation strategies that balance stocks, bonds, and other investments suitable for your goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations within each account to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about how to balance your investments effectively, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing contributions and investments across your accounts can greatly influence your financial success, so it’s worth taking the time to strategize accordingly.
