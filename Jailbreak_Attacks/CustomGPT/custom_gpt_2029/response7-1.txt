Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Goal:** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is effectively "free" money.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) or are likely to be held for shorter periods, as these will incur capital gains taxes. 

### 4. **Debt Considerations**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals.

### Conclusion
Create a balanced strategy focused on maximizing tax advantages and aligning with your financial goals. It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
