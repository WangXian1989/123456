Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
