I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best treatment often depends on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced, low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help. Reducing sugar and avoiding alcohol are key.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and help with weight management.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - For fatty liver disease, insulin-sensitizing agents or other medications may help.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests are crucial for managing liver health.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Reducing exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals, is important.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, such as liver cancer or advanced cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider before use.

For the best treatment plan, consult a healthcare professional who can consider your specific condition and medical history.
