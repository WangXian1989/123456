Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k): For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible; however, you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are generally tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains when you sell investments. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If you are closer to retirement, shift towards more stable investments (bonds, dividend stocks).
   - If you are younger, consider a higher allocation in stocks for potential growth.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Don't invest all your money in one type of account; diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) across all accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, based on market performance and changes in your financial circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your personal needs and goals.

By evaluating these factors and creating a balanced distribution that maximizes tax benefits, growth potential, and aligns with your retirement timeline, you can effectively manage your investments across these different accounts.
