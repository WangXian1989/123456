Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified distributions are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Aim to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This can provide flexibility in retirement to manage your tax liabilities.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or ETFs for capital gains treatment. They’re also useful for money you might need before retirement.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you’re younger and can afford to take more risks, leaning more towards equities in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial. As you get closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, consider seeking help from a financial professional.

This distribution strategy can help you maximize growth potential while managing your tax burden effectively.
