Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize employer match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to your IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) contributions**: After meeting the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k). Contributions reduce your taxable income now and grow tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable accounts**: If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but they come with tax considerations on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Consider placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth, while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

6. **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while Roth accounts can provide tax-free income.

7. **Review regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.
