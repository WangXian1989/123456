Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, maximize contributions (up to the annual limit) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell. Use them for investments that generate lower taxable distributions, like municipal bonds or growth stocks that you plan to hold long-term.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Distributions are taxed as ordinary income. Plan for tax implications when you withdraw funds in retirement.

3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio. Your overall risk tolerance and time horizon should guide your investment choices.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies and asset location to minimize taxesâ€”allocate more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) to tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you near retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds. For example, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.
