(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments you plan to sell before retirement, as they allow for more flexible withdrawals and can help manage capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, retirement accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) can hold more aggressive investments since they are long-term, while taxable accounts might benefit from more conservative investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation between accounts as you grow older or your financial situation changes. The right mix today might not be the right mix in five or ten years.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Hereâ€™s the deal: when it comes to distributing your cash across accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta play it smart. 

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, you wanna hit that maximum contribution like itâ€™s free candyâ€”donâ€™t leave money on the table! After that, if you can, pump some into a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Choose your poison based on whether you want to pay taxes now or later.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: Hereâ€™s where you can unleash some flexibility. These are great for dipping into early if you need cash without the penalties. Just keep an eye on your capital gains; nobody wants Uncle Sam knocking at the door.

3. **Mix It Up**: Balance your investments based on your age and how comfortable you are with risk. Younger folks can go wild with growth stocks; as you near retirement, scale back and focus on steady income.

4. **Keep Tweaking**: Don't just set it and forget it. Check in at least annually and adjust as life throws curveballs at you.

So, remember to keep your eye on the prize, diversify your investments, and donâ€™t forget about taxes! You got this!
