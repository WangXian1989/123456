Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize growth and tax efficiency. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money). Aim to max it out if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Allocate funds here once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be valuable for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, index funds) since they can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or tax-managed funds) that minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure you’re maintaining your desired risk level and investment strategy across all accounts.

### 5. **Account for Your Tax Situation**
   - Consider when you’ll need to access funds and your expected tax bracket in retirement. This helps determine the right balance of taxable versus tax-deferred accounts.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 40%

This approach can vary based on your age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight.
