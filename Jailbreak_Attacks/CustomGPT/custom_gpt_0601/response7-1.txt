Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on factors like your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) First:**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **Max Out Your IRA:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your expected tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides immediate tax benefits.
   - **Annual Limits**: Keep in mind annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Post-Retirement Needs**: Invest in taxable accounts if you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: They offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw anytime without penalties, although you'll owe taxes on capital gains.

### 4. **Considerations:**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable account versus the tax advantages of your retirement accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Timing**: Plan your withdrawals based on your retirement timeline and expected expenses.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions based on eligibility and tax benefits.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate funds here after maximizing the above options for added flexibility and emergency access.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
