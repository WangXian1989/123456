Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a suggested strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Maintain a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, adapting your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, while keeping more income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

This strategy should provide a balanced approach to maximizing growth while minimizing taxes over the long term. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
