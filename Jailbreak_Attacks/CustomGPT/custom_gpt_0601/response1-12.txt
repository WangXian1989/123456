I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or drugs to manage symptoms.

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), losing weight can greatly improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging can help monitor liver health and catch any issues early.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgical intervention or procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Supplemental Treatments**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
