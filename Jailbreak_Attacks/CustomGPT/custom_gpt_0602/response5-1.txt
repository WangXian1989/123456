(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Diversifying your investments across different account types can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match. Focus on growth-oriented assets if you're young; consider bonds as retirement nears.
   
2. **IRA**: Choose between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs might be tax-deductible now, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access. Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding long-term investments to minimize capital gains.

Balancing these accounts based on your retirement timeline, income needs, and tax situation is key.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to spread your cash around your accounts pretty much boils down to your goals, risk tolerance, and whether you like paying taxes or not!

1. **401(k)**: Go hard here first, especially if your employer matches. Thatâ€™s free money; donâ€™t leave it on the table! Load it up with aggressive stocks while you can. It's like a long gameâ€”just watch out for those fees!

2. **IRA**: Play the tax game smart here. If youâ€™re young and expect to earn more later, a Roth IRA could be your BFFâ€”tax-free growth, baby! But if you need that tax break now, the Traditional IRA is solid. Mix in some fun stuff here too, maybe a few index funds, throw in some high-growth stocks for good measure.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Think of these as your playground. You can buy and sell without penalties! Go for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, and rememberâ€”hold them long enough to dodge those nasty short-term capital gains. Balance it all like a financial tightrope walker, and you'll be golden! 

Mix it up and tweak as your life changes!
