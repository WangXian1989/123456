To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing the maximum allowable to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth if you wonâ€™t need access to the funds for many years.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate higher returns, like stocks or mutual funds, where taxes can compound over time.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize lower-yield investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, to manage tax implications more effectively.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes to your personal situation.

### Recommendation Example:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary, up to match limit.
- **IRA:** Max out individual contributions first.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds, focusing on liquid and flexible investments.

### Conclusion:
Balance contributions to optimize tax benefits while aligning with your financial goals and timelines. Regularly reassess as your financial situation changes.
