Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?** This is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the full match, if available.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA:** 
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but growth and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income now. Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.

### 3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k). This will reduce your taxable income and benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for:
     - Shorter-term goals (like buying a house)
     - Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in your taxable account, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust contributions as your situation changes (age, income, financial goals).

### Conclusion
This strategy helps you take advantage of tax benefits while balancing liquidity needs and growth potential. It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial circumstances.
