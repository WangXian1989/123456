Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider maximizing this if you have limited other retirement funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might be eligible for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Max out contributions if you can.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial for those in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t provide immediate tax relief but allow for more flexible access to funds without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investments. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they allow quicker access to funds.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline. Equities might work well in tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while bonds or less risky assets could balance your taxable accounts to manage capital gains tax.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your personal situation (e.g., salary increase, changes in financial goals).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, a financial advisor can guide you through optimizing your investment strategy.

By following this framework, you can effectively allocate your funds for growth while considering tax implications.
