Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a strategic overview:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments for long-term objectives. Consider your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use for more diversified investments, including bonds, stocks, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover investments, tax-efficient funds, or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawals Timing**: Understand how distributions from each account are taxed, especially in retirement.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts strategically to offset gains with losses to reduce taxes.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio regularly to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation can be invaluable.

By carefully structuring your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing your tax exposure effectively.
