Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Ensure you contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Higher Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
- **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
- **Lower Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the lower contribution limits for IRAs compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
- **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains tax.
- **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds:** Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### **General Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize your 401(k)** to at least the match level.
2. **Next, contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if you qualify and expect your tax rate to increase).
3. **After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, put any additional funds into a taxable account.**

### **Additional Considerations:**
- **Your Age & Timeline:** Younger investors might lean more heavily towards growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and income.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Determine your risk tolerance for investments in each account and allocate accordingly.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique financial situation and goals.
