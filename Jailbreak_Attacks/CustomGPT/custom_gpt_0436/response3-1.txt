Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be matched by your employer. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth and potential tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. However, they provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match amount, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Roth IRA Consideration**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments among stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for any changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the maximum match, focusing on growth-oriented investments.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions, using a mix of stocks for long-term growth or bonds for stability, depending on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or securities, focusing on short- and long-term investment goals. 

By tailoring your strategy to your circumstances, you can optimize your overall returns while managing tax implications effectively.
