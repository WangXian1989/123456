(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that match level; it's essentially free money. The contributions lower your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since you pay taxes on contributions, not withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexibility, as you wonâ€™t face penalties for early withdrawals. Keep in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains here.

Balancing these accounts based on contribution limits, tax advantages, and your personal financial situation is key. 

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The perfect strategy for dishing out your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to a mix of maximizing benefits and minimizing tax bites. Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k):** Hit that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza. Seriously, itâ€™s basically free money! Once youâ€™ve snagged that, contribute as much as you can because it lowers taxable income and has killer growth potential. Plus, tax-deferred growth is awesome.

2. **IRA:** Next up, dive into an IRA. If youâ€™re looking at a Roth, itâ€™s golden if you think your tax bracket will skyrocket in the future. Itâ€™s like investing with a tax-free cherry on top when you pull it out for retirement!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After you max out those sweet tax-advantaged options, toss whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. They donâ€™t have the same tax perks, but hey, you can pull out your cash whenever you want without penalties and still play the market game. Just keep your eye on how capital gains and dividends are gonna affect your tax situation.

Mix and match based on your life goals, and consult a pro if you want tailored advice, but thatâ€™s the gist. Happy investing!
