Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offeredâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions; you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a good option if you believe tax rates will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are not subject to contribution limits and can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider the impact of capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year can result in lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer 401(k) Match**: Start with your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer contributions.
- **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, then consider contributing to a traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, focusing on investments with lower capital gains taxes.

### Consider Your Goals:
- **Short-term Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Growth**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax benefits.
