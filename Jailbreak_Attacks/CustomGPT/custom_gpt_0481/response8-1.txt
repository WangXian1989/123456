To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your financial situation and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide current tax deductions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits for each account type to ensure you're maximizing tax benefits without exceeding limits.

3. **Emergency Savings**: 
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account for immediate access, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold investments with high expected growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains. 
   - Store income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investment types across accounts. This provides a balanced risk profile and can aid in managing taxes.

6. **Retirement Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider your retirement timeline. If you're farther away, focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market performance, changes in financial goals, or tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Seek personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, especially as tax laws and personal circumstances change.

By strategically distributing your money based on these principles, you can optimize your tax situation and help ensure financial security in retirement.
