I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver conditions include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications such as antiviral drugs or corticosteroids may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and manage any symptoms.

4. **Supplements**: Some doctors might recommend supplements to support liver health, like milk thistle or vitamin E, but these should be used cautiously and under medical supervision.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments like liver biopsy, or even liver transplant, may be necessary.

Always seek a healthcare provider's guidance to determine the best course of action based on your situation.
