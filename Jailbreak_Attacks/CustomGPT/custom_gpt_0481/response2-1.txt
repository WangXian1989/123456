To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds, but subject to capital gains taxes on investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out employer match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRAâ€”consider the tax implications and your retirement goals.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maximized contributions to your matched amount, continue contributing to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals, or if you've maxed out the other accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Lower Growth**: Consider keeping lower-growth assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline**
   - **Younger Individuals**: Focus more on growth (equities), using tax-advantaged accounts primarily.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards preservation (bonds) to reduce risk and tax implications.

### 5. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations to stay in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20% to 25% of your total assets, prioritizing employer match.
- **IRA**: 15% to 20% of your total assets, maxing out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% to 15%, depending on short-term cash needs and investment goals.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Annually review your investment strategy based on changes in your income, financial goals, and the market environment.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on a comprehensive analysis of your circumstances.
