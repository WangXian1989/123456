Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, prioritize IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth), depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth and more volatile investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow without annual taxes.
   - Keep more conservative, income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts where tax efficiency can be a consideration.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals. For instance, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals. Adjust contributions as needed to stay aligned with your overall strategy.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
