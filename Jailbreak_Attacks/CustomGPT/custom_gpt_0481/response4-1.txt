To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current tax rate and expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

2. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain some funds in a taxable account for short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties before age 59Â½.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes and potentially reduce capital gains.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Consider holding bonds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxation on interest and dividends.

4. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Set clear retirement goals. Adjust contributions based on age, projected retirement needs, and risk tolerance. Generally, the younger you are, the more aggressive your investments can be in retirement accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio and asset allocation to ensure alignment with changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seek personalized advice that considers your entire financial picture, including income, expenses, and future financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
