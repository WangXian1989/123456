Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, aim to max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends).
   - **Tax Diversification**: Maintain a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), IRA) and taxable accounts to provide flexibility in withdrawals and tax strategies during retirement.

### 3. **Align with Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Aggressive Growth in Retirement Accounts**: Focus on higher-risk investments like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, which benefit from compounded growth over time.
   - **Conservative Allocation in Taxable Accounts**: Consider income-generating investments (like bonds) that may be less volatile in your taxable account.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: If one account grows disproportionately, consider redirecting new contributions to balance your overall portfolio.

### 5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Assess how you will withdraw funds from each account type during retirement, keeping tax implications in mind to minimize your tax burden.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes over the long term. Always consult a financial advisor to personalize these strategies based on your unique circumstances.
