To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with tax benefits. Some include matching contributions which can boost your savings.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Options include Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (post-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax benefits but more liquid access to funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Max out contributions to these accounts first. Use these accounts for investments potentially subject to higher tax rates, like bonds or high-dividend stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient options such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**:
   - Allocate more to retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - Keep a buffer in taxable accounts for short-term expenses or emergencies.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that considers your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth, manage risks, and account for tax implications in your investment strategy.
