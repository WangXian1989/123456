The best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. Consider the investment options available.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for money you might need in the short-term or for investments that earn qualified dividends (lower tax rate) and long-term capital gains.
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments, such as ETFs or index funds, in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired investment strategy.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Think about the tax implications of withdrawing money from each account type in the future.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity, consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while managing risk and taxes effectively.
