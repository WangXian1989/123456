To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for investments with high growth potential (e.g., stocks) since they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that produce tax-efficient dividend income or capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your comfort with volatility and align your investments accordingly (e.g., more aggressive in retirement accounts if you have a long time horizon).
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across each account to minimize risk.

### 3. **Contribution Strategy**
   - Max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially to take advantage of any matching contributions.
   - Contribute to an IRA if eligible, focusing on Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances to maintain your desired risk profile.

By tailoring your investments to the specific advantages of each type of account, you can enhance your overall growth potential while managing taxes efficiently.
