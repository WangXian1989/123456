Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (often considered “free money”).
   - **Investment Options**: Compare the funds offered and their fees; choose low-cost index funds if available.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Current Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for both short-term goals and any excess savings after tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Capital Gains**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Max Out Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Tax Strategy**: Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains when possible.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Adjust these percentages based on your specific financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
