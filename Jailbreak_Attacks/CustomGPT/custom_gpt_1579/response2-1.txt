Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends received, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Aim to max out these accounts first, as they offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment opportunities that may benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates, or for funds you might need more quickly.

### 4. **Consider Your Timeline**
   - If you're far from retirement, consider contributing more to accounts with tax advantages.
   - Closer to retirement? Shift some funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and growth. Consider your risk tolerance and adjust as needed.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Your financial situation can change, so itâ€™s important to review your allocations periodically and adjust based on performance and life changes.

### Final Tip
Work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific goals and financial situation. This can provide personalized insights and help achieve optimal results!
