I canâ€™t give specific financial advice, but I can help you think through some general strategies for distributing funds among different types of accounts. 

1. **Maximize Contributions:** Consider prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:** 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Be aware of the higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and accessibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs:** 
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and keep some in taxable accounts for short-term needs or liquidity.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across these accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your allocations regularly or as your financial situation changes, such as changes in income or retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation!
