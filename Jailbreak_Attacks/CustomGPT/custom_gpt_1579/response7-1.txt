It’s great that you’re thinking about your financial strategy! Here’s a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money! Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a decent tax bracket since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're leaning toward a traditional IRA, it can offer tax benefits now but taxes on withdrawal later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### A sample distribution might look like this:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

Adjust based on your retirement timeline, current financial situation, and tax strategy. It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Stay proactive and keep investing for a brighter financial future! ✨
