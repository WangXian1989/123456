The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is often considered "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but there are income limits for high earners.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversification:** Spread investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash to mitigate risk. Your risk tolerance will dictate your specific allocation.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you need access to funds before retirement, consider allocating some savings to a taxable account. These funds can be used without penalties, unlike 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Periodic Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A personalized approach can yield the best results based on your unique situation.

Remember, these are general strategies, and you should tailor them to your specific needs and circumstances!
