2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the diagnosis, medications can help manage symptoms or treat conditions like hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supplements**:

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your medical history.
