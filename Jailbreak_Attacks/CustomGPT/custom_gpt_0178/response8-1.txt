Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is effectively free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for holding investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your desired asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) and apply this across all accounts, adjusting for tax efficiency. For instance, consider holding bonds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals carefully to minimize taxes, often starting with taxable accounts first.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and ensure strategic tax advantages.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
