Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that might be more tax-efficient or where you need access to funds before retirement.
   - Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio in response to changes in the market or your personal situation.

### Strategy Overview:
1. Maximize employer 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to IRA (consider Roth or traditional).
3. Invest in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and additional diversification.
4. Ensure you have an emergency fund and maintain regular portfolio reviews.
