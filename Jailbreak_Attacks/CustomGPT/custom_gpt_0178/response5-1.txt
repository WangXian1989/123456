Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, or index funds.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and access to funds. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
