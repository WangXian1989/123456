Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from your investment accounts. Avoid risky investments here.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to avoid higher taxes on dividends and interest.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts for favorable capital gains tax treatment.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - If you have specific goals (like buying a house or funding education), consider taxable accounts for greater flexibility and easier access.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach might look like maxing out any employer match in your 401(k), then contributing to an IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts as needed. Assess your situation and adjust these guidelines as necessary.

### Considerations
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
- Stay informed about any changes in tax law that may affect your strategy.
