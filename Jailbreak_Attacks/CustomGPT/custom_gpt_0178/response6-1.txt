Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you'll pay taxes on those annually.
   - **Long-term Investments:** Keep your lower-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Determine your risk tolerance and diversify your investments accordingly across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Before Retirement:** Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for contributions.
   - **During Retirement:** Strategically withdraw from taxable accounts first to minimize tax impact later, conserving tax-advantaged accounts for necessary withdrawals.

### Tips for Implementation
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation.
- **Monitor Performance:** Regularly review account performance and adjust contributions as needed based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

By strategically managing these accounts, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
