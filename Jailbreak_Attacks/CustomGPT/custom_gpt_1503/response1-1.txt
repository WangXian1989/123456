Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth may be a better option.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a separate, easily accessible account before investing heavily.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts first, as those can negate investment returns.

5. **Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, invest in diverse options available, focusing on low-cost index funds or target-date funds that automate the risk based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRAs**: Similar principles apply. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains and interest, as they might be taxed at a higher rate than qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

6. **Annual Contributions**: Maximize contributions according to IRS limits:
   - For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and align your money with your long-term goals.
