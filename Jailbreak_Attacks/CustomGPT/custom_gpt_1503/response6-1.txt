Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach based on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here are some steps and considerations:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages, but contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for money you may need before retirement. Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but there are no contribution limits.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Goals:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider funding your IRA, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, due to potential tax benefits.
   - Use your taxable account for investments with lower expected returns or for funds you might need in the short to medium term.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Best for assets expected to appreciate significantly, as gains will not be taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for investments you believe will grow substantially since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for investments generating regular income (like bonds) or those anticipated to be held for the long term to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Assess how long you plan to let your investments grow before needing to access them. Longer time horizons can justify a higher risk allocation in growth-oriented investments.
   - Balance your portfolios across accounts to meet your overall risk profile.

### 5. **Annual Review:**
   - Regularly review and readjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts while keeping tax and growth opportunities in mind, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term success. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your situation.
