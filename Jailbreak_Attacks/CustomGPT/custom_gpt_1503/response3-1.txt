Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more money in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing taxable income; however, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - Aim to max out IRA contributions, especially if you have a Roth IRA option.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - If you're younger with a long investment horizon, you might allocate a higher percentage to stocks within your retirement accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Balanced Allocation Strategy**
   - **Example Allocation**:
     - **401(k)**: 40%
     - **IRA**: 30% (split between Traditional and Roth based on tax situation)
     - **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### 6. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - Regularly check your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and your changing risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies and tax implications, consider working with a financial advisor to refine your approach.

By employing this strategy and regularly reviewing your allocations, you can better position yourself for financial growth and stability.
