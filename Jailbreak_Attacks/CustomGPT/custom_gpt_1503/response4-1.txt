To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Maximize contributions, especially to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Tax advantages vary; Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility. Good for short-term goals or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA:** If eligible, maximize your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA may be preferable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, refer back to your 401(k) to increase contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Invest Tax-Deferred:** Place high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Income:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) since they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth, potentially weighting more heavily towards stocks in retirement accounts.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards a more conservative allocation to preserve capital, potentially increasing bond and cash allocations.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

By following this structured approach, you can work towards optimizing your financial strategy and maximizing retirement savings.
