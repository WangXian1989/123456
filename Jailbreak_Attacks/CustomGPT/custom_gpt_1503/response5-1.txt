Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contribute to these types of accounts first as they offer tax benefits. For traditional accounts, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess whether you prefer the tax benefit now (traditional) or later (Roth).
   
3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for these accounts. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up option for those aged 50 and older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Assess Tax Efficiency**: Taxable accounts often have capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that are less prone to rapid growth (like bonds or real estate) in these accounts, while keeping high-growth assets in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets in a savings or money market account before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, your asset allocation might drift. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your intended risk level.

7. **Long-term Perspective**: Consider your time horizon for each account. If you’re nearing retirement, you may want to reduce risk in your 401(k) and IRA, while perhaps being more aggressive in your taxable accounts if you have longer-term goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations can be complex. An advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

By aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals and tax situation, you can optimize your investment distribution among these accounts effectively.
