Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match (401(k))
- **Contribution Strategy**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 3. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Investment Strategy**: Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility but may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. Asset Allocation Considerations
- **Investments**: Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral. Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. Evaluate Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Bracket**: Assess your current and projected tax brackets. If you're in a lower bracket now, it may be wise to convert some traditional accounts to Roth accounts.

### 6. Regular Review
- **Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to ensure they align with your retirement goals and market conditions.
