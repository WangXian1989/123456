The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Great for high earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have a retirement plan at work. Suitable if you're eligible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debts before heavy investing.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce taxable income, such as dividends or interest. This can include stocks or mutual funds you might hold for the long term.

6. **Diversified Portfolio**: Maintain a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to spread risk.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10–15% of your income, focusing on maximum match first.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Up to the annual contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any residual income here, especially for mid-term goals or additional growth outside of retirement limits.

### Regular Review
Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial priorities.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
