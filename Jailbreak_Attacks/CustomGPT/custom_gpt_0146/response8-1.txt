Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your returns and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Fill 401(k) to Maximum Contribution**: After the match, consider reaching the annual contribution limit on your 401(k).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use tax-loss harvesting and be mindful of your income levels when withdrawing from these accounts in the future.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, or tax laws.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
