To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match and consider maxing it out if you can afford it. 
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After your tax-advantaged accounts are funded, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals. These offer liquidity and can provide dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of the fees associated with investments in all accounts, as they can impact your overall returns.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your unique financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This strategy helps balance growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
