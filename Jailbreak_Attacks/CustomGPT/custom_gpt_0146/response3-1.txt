Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often 50% up to a certain percentage). This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may trigger short-term capital gains (like trading stocks). Focus on long-term investments here to minimize taxes.

### 3. Balance Your Contributions:
   - Allocate funds according to your total retirement goals. For example:
     - **50% to 401(k)** (including employer match)
     - **30% to IRA**
     - **20% to taxable accounts**

### 4. Adjust Based on Your Situation:
   - If you are closer to retirement, consider moving more to tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income now.
   - If you are younger, you might prioritize Roth contributions for long-term tax benefits.

### 5. Review Regularly:
   - Reassess your allocation annually as your income, tax laws, and retirement goals change.

### Key Takeaway:
Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then fill in with taxable accounts based on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
