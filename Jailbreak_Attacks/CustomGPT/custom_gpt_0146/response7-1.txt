To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, which offers tax benefits.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals are taxed for traditional accounts.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. Use this account for flexible access to funds.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Conservative Growth in Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Use these accounts for growth-oriented investments, as they defer taxes on gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or cash-equivalents before making significant investments.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment choices and asset allocation based on life changes and market conditions.

### Sample Distribution
- **401(k)**: 10-20% of income up to match
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently, $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any leftover savings or investments

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions based on these guidelines can help maximize growth while considering tax implications. It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
