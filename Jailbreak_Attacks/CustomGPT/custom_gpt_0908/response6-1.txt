Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough:** Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose a mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Annual Limits:** Contribute the maximum allowed each year to boost your retirement savings.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Emergency Funds:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or an emergency fund, as they offer liquidity without penalties.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free appreciation.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Review Asset Allocation:** Periodically assess your investment mix to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

By strategically allocating your contributions and investments, you can optimize the growth of your money while minimizing tax implications. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
