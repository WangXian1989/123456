To optimally distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs function similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, and dividends are taxed as income.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out IRA contributions if possible, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, lean toward taxable accounts, as they offer more flexibility.
   - If youâ€™re saving for long-term goals like retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account to manage risk and growth potential, adjusting based on your age and risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and long-term goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your accounts while maximizing tax efficiency and aligning with your financial goals.
