Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it a good option for tax diversification.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts depending on your tax situation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly from tax-free accounts.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts strategically can help you maximize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
