I'm not a healthcare professional, but it's important to consult a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopting a balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**:
   - Regular check-ups with liver function tests and imaging.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific circumstances.
