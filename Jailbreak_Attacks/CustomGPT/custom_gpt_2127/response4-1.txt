Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - Maximize employer contributions: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribution limits: Be aware of the annual contribution limits set by the IRS. For 2023, the limit for employee contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Types of IRAs: Choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). Your choice may depend on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rates.
   - Contribution limits: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: Allocate money to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, as these accounts do not have the same contribution limits and withdrawal restrictions.
   - Investment selection: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

4. **Investment strategies**:
   - Diversification: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Asset location: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Have a long-term plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, focusing on minimizing taxes and ensuring your withdrawals last throughout retirement.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your personal finances, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
