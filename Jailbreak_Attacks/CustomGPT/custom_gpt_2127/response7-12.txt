I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. For specific recommendations, you should consult a healthcare professional who can assess your condition.

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes such as viral hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping up with routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health is often recommended.
4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, surgical interventions or procedures such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
