Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income levels and tax bracket. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA offer immediate tax deductions, reducing your taxable income. Conversely, withdrawals from these accounts in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you pay taxes at a lower rate now than you expect in the future.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Utilize your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments with potentially higher returns. Focus on stocks or mutual funds in these accounts.
   - In taxable accounts, you may want to hold investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-exempt municipal bonds, to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Determine your expected retirement expenses. Tax-advantaged accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals, so plan to use those funds strategically to avoid unnecessary taxes.
   - Balance your withdrawals between taxable and tax-advantaged accounts based on your income needs and tax implications.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified by asset class and risk. Do not overload any single account type with high-risk investments; instead, spread risk across all accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy, especially as tax laws change, your financial situation evolves, or as you approach retirement.

In conclusion, a tailored approach considering tax advantages, investment growth potential, withdrawal strategies, and diversification will help in efficiently distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
