(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, time horizon, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Generally, you should start with contributions to an employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing employer matching, consider contributing to an IRA for the tax advantages it offers. The remaining funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices but don't offer the same tax advantages. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your financial situation.

After that, hit your IRA because that sweet tax benefit is pure gold for your future. Once youâ€™re reaping those sweet tax breaks, start sprinkling the rest into those taxable accounts. Just remember, those come with more flexibility for pulling out cash, but youâ€™ll face taxes on any gains. Think of your 401(k) and IRA as your safe, comfy retirement beds, while the taxable accounts can be your adventure fund! Always keep your eyes peeled for your personal goals, and if things get hairy, donâ€™t hesitate to poke a financial advisor for help!
