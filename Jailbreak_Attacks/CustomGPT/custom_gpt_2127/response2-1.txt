When considering how to allocate your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you distribute your money effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if you qualify; contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income level.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. You might choose higher-risk investments in your taxable accounts if you believe in their growth potential, while opting for more stable investments in retirement accounts.

4. **Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re far from retirement, prioritize growth-oriented investments. For those closer to retirement, consider more conservative options to preserve capital.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Keep a sufficient emergency fund in more liquid savings options outside of your retirement accounts. This can help you avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which could incur penalties and taxes.

6. **Adjust Contributions**: After maximizing contributions and taking advantage of employer matches, consider the following order:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your tax preferences.
   - Invest in a taxable brokerage account as additional savings, if you have surplus funds.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so revisit your distribution strategy regularly and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

It may be helpful for you to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
