The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Focus on taxable accounts.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):**
     - Pre-tax contributions (tax-deferred growth).
     - Employer match if available (free money).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Traditional IRAs: Tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth.
     - Roth IRAs: Contributions made after taxes, tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Flexibility in withdrawals.
     - Possible capital gains tax on investments.

### 3. **Strategic Allocation**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Fund an IRA:**
     - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially for Roth if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these accounts for short-term savings or for funds beyond retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and traditional IRA.
   - Use Roth accounts for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax when managing taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Monitor performance and rebalance your portfolio annually.
   - Adjust contributions based on changing financial circumstances or goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **If youâ€™re under 50:**
  - 401(k): Max out contributions up to $22,500.
  - IRA: Contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
  - Remaining funds in taxable accounts as needed.

### Final Thoughts
Future contributions depend on your income, retirement plans, and investment strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
