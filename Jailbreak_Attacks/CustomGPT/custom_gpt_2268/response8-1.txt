To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: How close are you to retirement?
   - **Other Financial Goals**: Do you have any short- or mid-term needs?

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers tax advantages; consider maximizing employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement); choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   1. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match.
   2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing your contribution to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and to meet short-term needs once 401(k) and IRA contributions are maxed out.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of stock and bond funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategy as your 401(k), but consider broader options available in IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
