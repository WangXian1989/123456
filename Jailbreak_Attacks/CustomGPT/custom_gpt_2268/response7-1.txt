To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit, focusing on a Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any excess funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### 2. **Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices; consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader investment range, so you can diversify more effectively.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in investments, but consider tax efficiency (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to better utilize your tax brackets.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering tax implications from each account, withdrawing from accounts strategically to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

### Summary
Maximize contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first, invest strategically based on tax implications, and regularly review your plan to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.
