Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: How far are you from retirement?
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Do you need access to cash before retirement?

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, higher contribution limits, but may have limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, but earnings are taxed.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for immediate tax savings if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - Use Roth accounts for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
   - **Boost IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Allocate Residual Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across various asset classes.

### 6. **Periodic Review**
   - Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
