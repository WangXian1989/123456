(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first since it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing your match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for further tax advantages. If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Bracket:** Depending on your income and tax bracket, prioritize contributions that give you the most tax benefit. For example, if you're in a high tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Make sure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline. Maintain diversification across accounts to manage risk effectively.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your needs.
