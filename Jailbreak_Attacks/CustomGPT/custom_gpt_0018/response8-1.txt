It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! While I can't provide personalized financial advice, I can share some general principles that might help you determine how to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), benefiting from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, respectively. Max out to any employer match to take full advantage.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it offers tax advantages, whether traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Limits apply, so know your contribution limits for each type of IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investing here doesnâ€™t provide the same tax advantages, but this flexibility allows easy access to funds without penalties.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (generally 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before investing significantly in these accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
   - Generally, you may want to hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax impact, while putting higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Maximize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-yielding investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Consider using dollar-cost averaging, which involves regularly contributing the same amount of money over time, potentially reducing the impact of market volatility.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, or life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual situations vary significantly, consider discussing your plan with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.

Always consider your personal circumstances and long-term goals when deciding on your investment strategy! If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask.
