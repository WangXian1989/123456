When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few principles to consider for optimization. üí° Here‚Äôs a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially free money! After that, aim to contribute as much as you can up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on which you qualify for and see more benefit from (tax deductions vs. tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or dividends, as they will be taxed at your income tax rate. Stocks held long-term (over a year) are generally taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

3. **Balance Risk and Return**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds or stable income investments.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place before aggressively investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve. 

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation! üè¶üí∞
