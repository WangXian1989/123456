When determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, but if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility with withdrawals, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits. If you're investing for shorter-term goals, this may be beneficial.

4. **Investment Choices**: Evaluate the investment options available in each account. 401(k)s often have a limited selection, while IRAs and taxable accounts allow for broader investment choices.

5. **Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. For long-term growth, a higher allocation in stocks may be appropriate, while more conservative investments may be suitable for nearer-term goals.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how soon you may need access to your money. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity, while retirement accounts have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the performance of different investments may shift your asset allocation. Regularly review and adjust as needed to maintain your desired distribution and risk level.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation and goals.
