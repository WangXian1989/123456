(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. A common approach includes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After getting the employer match, consider putting additional funds into a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

3. **Fill Up 401(k) Contributions**: If you can contribute more, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for any additional savings. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you can choose tax-efficient investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down in a super straightforward way. Think of your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like different buckets for your money. Here's how to fill â€˜em up:

1. **401(k)**: First things first, if your job throws in a match, dive into that! Free money is like finding a twenty in your winter coat. Max out the match before moving to the next bucket.
   
2. **IRA**: After you've snagged that employer match, hit up your IRA. Depending on whether you're feeling traditional or Roth, this one is great for either pre-tax or post-tax benefits, respectively. Itâ€™s like picking your flavor.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If youâ€™ve still got more to stash away, max out your 401(k) contributions. These accounts let you hide money from Uncle Sam longer, which is sweet.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, anything left over? Toss that into a taxable account for more flexibility. You can pull from this without strings attached when you need it. But be mindful of taxes on capital gains!

In the end, figure out what makes sense for your situation, maybe consult a pro to get your game plan on lock. You got this!
