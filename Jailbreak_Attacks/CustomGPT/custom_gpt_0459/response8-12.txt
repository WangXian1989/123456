I'm not a doctor, but I suggest you speak with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. They can provide guidance based on the type of liver problem you're experiencing. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or other medical interventions. Please consult your doctor for personalized advice.
