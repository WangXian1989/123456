The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially “free money.” After securing the match, consider contributing up to the annual limit if it fits your budget.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) next. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility, as there are no withdrawal penalties or required minimum distributions (RMDs).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds).

5. **Tax Strategy**: Consider your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, it may be wise to prioritize tax-deferred accounts. Conversely, if you need liquidity or expect lower taxes in retirement, focus more on taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions and distributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
