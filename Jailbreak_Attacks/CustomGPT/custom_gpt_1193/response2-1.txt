When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to factor in your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now or in the future.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Once you've taken full advantage of your employer match, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives across all accounts. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth will be tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth).

6. **Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Consider holding investments with higher expected returns in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Check your allocation periodically and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk levels.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances can vary widely. A certified financial planner can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation, including income levels, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial circumstances and goals.
