It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some points to keep in mind:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Look for employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and their associated fees. If the fees are high compared to other investment options, it may be wise to limit contributions to the 401(k) once you get the match.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Contributing to an IRA may offer more investment flexibility than a 401(k), as IRAs generally have a wider range of investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term than retirement, such as buying a home, funding education, or other large expenses.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when investing in a taxable account. Investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains usually have more favorable tax treatment compared to ordinary income.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially those with employer matching.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, considering asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan specific to your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your personal financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Prioritize tax-advantaged options while also maintaining liquidity for short-term needs in taxable accounts.
