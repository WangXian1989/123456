(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, as this can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it could be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These can give you more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

It's essential to assess your individual circumstances and perhaps consult a financial advisor to develop a plan tailored to your needs.

1. **401(k):** This bad boy is where you wanna start. If your company matches contributions, throw enough in there to snag that free cash! Going for the max contribution? Hell yes! Youâ€™ll be making the taxman cry while boosting your retirement.

2. **IRA:** Next, you've got your IRA options. Go with a Roth if you can â€“ tax-free growth is the name of the game when your golden years roll around! Traditional IRA? Itâ€™s cool too, but keep an eye on those future taxes. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve flexed on those retirement accounts, dive into a brokerage for your taxable account. This lets you play the long game while keeping your options open. Need cash for a vacation? Swoop in on that without penalties!

In the end, it's all about balancing immediate needs and future security. Donâ€™t forget to check in with a financial planner for that extra sprinkle of wisdom! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
