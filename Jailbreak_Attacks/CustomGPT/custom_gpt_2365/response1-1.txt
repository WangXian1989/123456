When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Typically, these are more flexible, but they don't offer the same tax advantages. Use these accounts for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) since youâ€™ll pay taxes on those earnings annually.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might mean having a mix of equities, fixed income, and other assets across all account types.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is especially important in a taxable account due to the tax implications of selling investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal finance can be complex, and a financial advisor can give tailored advice based on your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, the best strategy is to align your investment approach with your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
