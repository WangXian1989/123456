When structuring your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a balanced approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you’re maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit. This is particularly beneficial if your employer offers a diverse set of investment choices.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After you’ve optimized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments that may not fit into your retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on an asset allocation strategy (e.g., stocks vs. bonds) that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals, and apply it across all accounts for risk management.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market fluctuations.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your personal financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
