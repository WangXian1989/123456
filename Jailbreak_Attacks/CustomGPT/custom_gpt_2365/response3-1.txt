When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the account types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers; contributions are pre-tax (or Roth - after-tax), which can reduce your taxable income. Employer matches can also contribute significantly to your retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: You can choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions), both with tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These are standard investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility and access to funds.

2. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider tax implications**: Generally, it makes sense to put higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) because the tax impact on growth can be significant. High-income assets can also generate more taxes if in taxable accounts, so consider placing these in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Set goals for retirement**: Define your retirement timeline and financial goals. If retirement is far off, consider being more aggressive with growth-oriented investments in retirement accounts, while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Diversification can help manage risk. You can hold different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in your various accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Rebalance annually**: Review your investment distributions regularly and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Consult a financial advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

A suggested approach could be:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- Max out contributions to your IRA.
- Invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts while considering your risk tolerance.

This can ensure you're taking full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts while also maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts.
