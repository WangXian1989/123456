When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take several factors into account, including your investment goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, focus on tax-advantaged accounts. Here’s a quick breakdown:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Consider your current and expected future tax rates to decide which type is best for your situation.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), IRAs can be traditional or Roth. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA allows your funds to grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Remember that investment income (like dividends and capital gains) will be taxed in the year it is recognized.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Assets can be allocated more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts, while you might want to hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts to avoid taxes on high-yield investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you get closer to retirement, think about how you will start withdrawing from these accounts. A strategy that minimizes taxes and maximizes the longevity of your funds is beneficial.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or life events.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
