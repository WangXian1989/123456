To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match and maximize your IRA contributions. This minimizes your taxable income.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these accounts for assets likely to generate capital gains, as tax rates can be beneficial depending on your income level.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place equities with higher growth potential in your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing bonds in your taxable accounts, as they generate interest income that is generally taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Rebalancing Strategy**
   - **Regular Review**: Assess your portfolio allocation at least annually and adjust to maintain your desired risk level.
   - **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, sell underperforming investments to offset gains and reduce tax liability.

### Conclusion
By strategically distributing your funds and choosing where to place certain assets, you can enhance your overall investment returns while minimizing your tax burden. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
