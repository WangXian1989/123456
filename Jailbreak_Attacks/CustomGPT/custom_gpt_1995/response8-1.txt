Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits (deductions for Traditional, tax-free growth for Roth).

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) or where you might need liquidity without penalty.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Mix between stocks and bonds based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider the tax implications of where you hold different types of assets (bonds generally generate interest, which is taxed at ordinary income rates).

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

### General Suggested Order:
1. Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Additional savings in the 401(k) if you have spare income.
4. Invest in taxable accounts as needed for flexibility.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider consulting a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
