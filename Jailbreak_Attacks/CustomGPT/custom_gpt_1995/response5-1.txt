Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Consider making the maximum contribution if you're able.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

2. **Evaluate Withdrawals and Tax Implications**:
   - Money in a 401(k) or IRA will be taxed upon withdrawal, while taxable accounts allow you to pay capital gains taxes only when you sell investments. Balance your withdrawals based on your expected tax bracket in retirement versus now.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, avoiding penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to adjust for market changes or shifts in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
