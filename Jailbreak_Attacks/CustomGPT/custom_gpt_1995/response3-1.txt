To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Define short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment; Roth IRAs use post-tax contributions for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested money is subject to capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be funded last, typically used for goals that are more immediate or to maintain liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and goal specifics. Generally, consider stocks for long-term growth and bonds for stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Getting personalized advice based on your financial situation can provide additional insights.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement contributions
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement contributions
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of savings for flexibility

Adjust based on your specific financial situation and goals.
