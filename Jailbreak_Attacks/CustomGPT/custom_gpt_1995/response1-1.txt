Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you have a higher tax rate.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Structure your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) should be in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on market conditions, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This strategy can help you build wealth while minimizing taxes over your lifetime.
