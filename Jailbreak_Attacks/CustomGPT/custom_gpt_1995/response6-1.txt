Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible. 

### 2. **Optimize Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income; good for high earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth accounts:** Pay taxes now for tax-free growth, ideal for individuals expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Debt Considerations**
   - Pay off high-interest debt before significantly investing in taxable accounts. 

### 4. **Diversifying Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments with lower tax implications (e.g., index funds, tax-efficient stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

### 5. **Periodic Reassessment**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Conclusion
Aim for a balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts but adapting as your financial situation and goals evolve.
