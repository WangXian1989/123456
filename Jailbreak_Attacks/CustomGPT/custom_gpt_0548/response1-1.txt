Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth for Roth 401(k)s) and grow tax-deferred. Prioritize maxing out contributions if you have the means.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: Use a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and future tax expectations.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Holding money in both traditional and Roth accounts helps manage taxes in retirement by allowing you to withdraw from either based on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility and liquidity. They’re ideal for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments here (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions based on employer matches and tax benefits.
- Consider your short-term vs. long-term financial goals.
- Regularly reassess your portfolio to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
