To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (or after-tax in the case of a Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income. Employers may match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes on dividends.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your time horizon and investment goals. If you plan to retire in the near future, focus on more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals, you might invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Timing**:
   - Understand penalties for early withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA funds are typically penalized if taken before age 59.5, while you can withdraw contributions from a Roth IRA tax- and penalty-free.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset classes (stock, bonds, real estate) based on tax implications.

5. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Be mindful of RMDs in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs, which require withdrawals starting at age 73.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match initially.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you're looking at a Roth for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest surplus funds in a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### Example Distribution Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-25% of total savings
- **IRA**: 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 55-65%

### Periodic Review
Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and to stay updated on the latest tax implications and investment options.
