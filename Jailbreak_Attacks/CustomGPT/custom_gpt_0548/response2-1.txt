When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - Consider tax advantages: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth options allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Choose between Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - Maximize contributions: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over age 50). 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use after-tax savings: Contribute any additional savings here, focusing on investments that yield lower taxes (e.g., qualified dividends, long-term capital gains).
   - Diversify investment types: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and potentially tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

4. **General Allocation Tips:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses in an accessible account.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Depending on your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals, structure your portfolio (stocks, bonds, cash) accordingly.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investments annually and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing life circumstances.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation and goals.
