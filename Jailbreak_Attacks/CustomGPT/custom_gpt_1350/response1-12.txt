I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan. However, here are some general approaches that may be helpful for liver health:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol, excess sugars, and saturated fats.

2. **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, along with strength training exercises.

3. **Weight Management**: If you're overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can improve liver health.

4. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help the liver function properly.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Limit exposure to harmful substances, including certain over-the-counter medications and chemicals.

6. **Regular Check-ups**: Stay in touch with your healthcare provider for regular liver function tests and follow their recommendations.

7. **Medication**: In some cases, medications may be necessary to address specific liver conditions, so be sure to discuss this with your doctor.

Always discuss these options with a healthcare provider to ensure they fit your specific situation. Your health is important, and proactive management can make a difference!
