(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer's match first, as this is essentially free money. If possible, contribute enough to reach the maximum limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as this allows for tax-free withdrawals later. If you prefer tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of tax implications on your gains.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag that employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Aim to max it out if you can. Just think of it as stuffing cash into a tax-advantaged piggy bank thatâ€™ll grow until you retire.

2. **IRA**: Next up is the IRA duo. If youâ€™re all about that future tax-free life, go for the Roth IRA. Youâ€™ll pay taxes now, but future you will thank you as you sip cocktails on a beach, completely tax-free! But if you need that tax break today, slide into a traditional IRA instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, chuck what you can into taxable accounts. These are your wild cardsâ€”easy access for short-term needs, but remember Uncle Sam's gonna want his cut of those gains. Itâ€™s a balancing act! 

Just a heads up, meet with a financial guru to tailor this strategy so you can absolutely crush your financial goals!
