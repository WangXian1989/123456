To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**: 
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax advantages. Contributions are often pre-tax, and the growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Another retirement savings account, which can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside retirement accounts. Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

2. **Contribute to Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these provide significant tax advantages. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 with catch-up contributions if you're 50 or older).

4. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: 
   - If you plan to contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA, consider the benefits of the Roth IRA if you qualify.  Contributions to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can be beneficial for long-term growth, while bonds may provide stability.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax implications.

7. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**: 
   - At least once a year, review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure you stay on track with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
