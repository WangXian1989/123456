Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, as it reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA as well. A Traditional IRA can help with reducing taxable income now, whereas a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and anticipated future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts or if you need more liquidity, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is crucial for investments that might be needed before retirement or for more flexible investment options.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. **401(k) up to the employer match**
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth) up to limit**
3. **401(k) up to maximum limit**
4. **Taxable accounts for additional investments or savings needs**

### Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices within these accounts are well-diversified.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: If you plan to retire early, consider your withdrawal strategies from these accounts, as they have different tax implications.
- **Consult a Professional**: It's often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's best for you.

Adjust this approach based on your specifics, such as age, income, and financial goals.
