To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income level.
  
2. **Balance Between Growth and Access:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Invest Based on Goals:** Use your taxable account for investments with short-term goals, while keeping long-term growth investments in your retirement accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation Considerations:**
   - Allocate more aggressively in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from compound growth over time.
   - Keep more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

By strategizing your contributions based on these principles, you can optimize your wealth accumulation while being mindful of tax implications. Always reassess your distribution regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.
