When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors like your financial goals, retirement timeline, and current tax situation. Here are some general strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be advantageous due to tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, so consider your expected income in retirement to determine how much you want to allocate to these accounts. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more favorable.

4. **Balance Growth and Access:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalties. Consider allocating some of your savings here, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement or want to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts to reduce risk. Each account can hold a mix of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Review and adjust your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals, market performance, and changes in your life situation.

It's a wise idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances and optimize your investment approach.
