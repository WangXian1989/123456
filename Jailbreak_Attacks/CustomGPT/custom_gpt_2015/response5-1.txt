Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, consider paying that down before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.

4. **Continue to Fund the 401(k)**: Increase your 401(k) contributions if you haven't reached the annual limit. This continues to provide tax advantages.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals but is subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In your taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: As your income, tax situation, and financial goals change over time, reassess your allocation to ensure alignment.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
