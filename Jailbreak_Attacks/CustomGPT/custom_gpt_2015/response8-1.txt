Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Prioritize funding a Roth IRA (if you're eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on bonds or high-yield investments in these accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - For short-term goals, such as buying a home, keep funds in a taxable account.
   - For long-term retirement expenses, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This can help with risk management and potential returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - When withdrawing funds in retirement, consider starting with taxable accounts before tapping into tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Reviews and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on your financial situation, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.
