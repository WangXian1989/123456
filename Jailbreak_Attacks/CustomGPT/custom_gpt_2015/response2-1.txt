Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If eligible, the Roth IRA provides tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are typically:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 3. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - Balance short-term needs and long-term growth. If you anticipate needing funds soon, you might allocate more to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Diversify your investment choices within each account. This could include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Riskier investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) that benefit from tax deferral.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Adjust contributions as needed based on performance and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

By following this guideline, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
