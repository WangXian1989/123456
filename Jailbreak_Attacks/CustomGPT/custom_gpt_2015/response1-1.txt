Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next, as these accounts offer tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so prioritize assets that generate minimal taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

3. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding higher-growth investments (stocks) since you wonâ€™t face taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) that might be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Adjust Based on Your Age and Goals:**
   - Younger investors may focus on growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement might prioritize income generation.
   - Rebalance periodically based on market performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Review Your Overall Financial Plan:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By adopting these approaches, you can effectively manage your investments across these accounts for both growth and tax efficiency.
