To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - If eligible, contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. For Roth IRAs, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Consider holding assets that produce qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Determine Your Investment Goals**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
     - Younger individuals may lean more toward stocks within tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
     - As retirement nears, shift toward bonds to stabilize your portfolio.

### 4. **Diversification Strategies**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how you will draw down your accounts in retirement to maximize after-tax income.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Tailor this to your specific situation, adjusting based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement.
