Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider a traditional 401(k) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and make the most of them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more immediate access to your funds without penalties. They can be useful for short-term goals or investing more freely without contribution limits.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on holding investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize building an emergency fund before aggressively investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Consider your investment horizon; longer timelines allow for more aggressive investments.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Final Considerations:
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, including retirement age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of changes in tax law or contribution limits that may affect your strategy.

By systematically approaching your contributions and understanding the benefits of each account type, you can optimize your investment strategy for financial growth.
