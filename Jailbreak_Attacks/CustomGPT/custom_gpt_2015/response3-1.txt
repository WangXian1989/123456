Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching, pre-tax contributions, and potential tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level, you may benefit from a Roth or Traditional IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes on profits, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. Consider maxing out if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out the match and IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contribution to the annual limit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically focus on long-term growth by allocating more to equities. Align your investments with your risk tolerance and retirement horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate frequent taxable events (like high-dividend stocks) or investments you may need to access before retirement (like a home purchase).

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth to avoid short-term capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Annually review your asset allocation and financial goals.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, life events, or investment performance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances, particularly regarding tax strategies and investment choices.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your assets across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes.
