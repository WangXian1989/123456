To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; often includes employer match potential.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Also offers tax advantages, with Roth allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on earnings, but offers flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and a key part of your retirement savings strategy.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for savings. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use the taxable account for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate lower tax obligations (like index funds).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Balance stock and bond allocations according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when and how you will withdraw from each account. Generally, itâ€™s optimal to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings.
