I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adjusting your diet (reducing alcohol, eating a balanced diet) and incorporating regular exercise can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or corticosteroids.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal supplements, but always consult with your doctor first.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy or even a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments for blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
