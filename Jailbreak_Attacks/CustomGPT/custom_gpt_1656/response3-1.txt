To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Further 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), up to the maximum limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may have lower tax implications, such as index funds or municipal bonds. This can help you manage capital gains and tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to tax-free growth.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.

Make sure to adapt your strategy as your financial situation evolves!
