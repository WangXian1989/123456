I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Intervention Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like endoscopy or surgery may be necessary, especially if there are obstructions.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

5. **Supplements**: Discuss if any vitamin or herbal supplements may be beneficial, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
