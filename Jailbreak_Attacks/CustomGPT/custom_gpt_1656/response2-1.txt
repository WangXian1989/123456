Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax advantages depending on the account type.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After taking advantage of the IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a higher income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax, while tax-advantaged accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
