To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Best for higher-income earners seeking immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments like stocks or ETFs, where you can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. Ideal for investment flexibility or short-term needs.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate different types of assets across accounts to optimize tax implications. For example, hold bonds in tax-deferred accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for potential tax efficiency.
   - Balance your total portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to use these accounts in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide more flexible access, while 401(k)s and IRAs have rules and penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment distribution and rebalance as needed to maintain your asset allocation strategy over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
