Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Great for high earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with potential income limitations on deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Good if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement. Interest and dividends are taxed annually, but capital gains can be tax-efficient if you hold investments long-term.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your investments based on performance and changes in financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help you align your investment strategy with your personal financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of each account type while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential.
