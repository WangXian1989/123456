Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in this account for short-term goals and to maintain liquidity. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Tolerance
- **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment choices based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals, a more aggressive approach in your 401(k) and IRA is advisable, while your taxable account can hold more conservative investments.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalancing
- Monitor your asset allocation regularly to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and goals.

### Conclusion
A well-balanced approach considering tax efficiency, investment goals, and risk tolerance can optimize your wealth accumulation.
