Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Evaluate your tax situation to determine which is more beneficial:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. Focus on Asset Allocation
- Diversify investments within these accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings:
  - Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (e.g., stock funds).
  - Take advantage of tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
- Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation to align with changing goals and market conditions.

### 5. Consider Your Time Horizon
- For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts provide more access.

### Conclusion
Strive for a balanced approach that maximizes tax benefits while ensuring flexibility. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
