To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after reaching your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This can be beneficial for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This plan will help you maximize tax benefits while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
