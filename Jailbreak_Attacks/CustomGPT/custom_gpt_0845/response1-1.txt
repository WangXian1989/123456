The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can be taxed on gains and dividends.

3. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

4. **Assess Your Immediate Needs**: If you need access to funds before retirement, maintaining a robust taxable account can provide liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Financial situations can change, so it’s wise to review and adjust your allocations as needed annually.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
