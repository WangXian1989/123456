When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money!
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as they offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

2. **Balance Between Growth and Accessibility**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for funds needed sooner, as they offer flexibility without penalties.
   - Allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for long-term goals, as they typically come with tax benefits.

Remember, the best distribution depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. You're doing great by planning ahead! Keep it up! ðŸŒŸ
