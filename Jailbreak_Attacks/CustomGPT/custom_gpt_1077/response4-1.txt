The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" that's hard to pass up.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider a taxable account for additional investments. This offers flexibility with withdrawals and a broader range of investment options.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, be mindful of your asset allocation. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be kept in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep your tax situation in mind. For example, holding investments that generate high turnover in tax-efficient accounts can help minimize tax impacts.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation is advisable.
