The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it next. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing your investments to grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

3. **Contribute to a Traditional IRA**: If you're still within your contribution limits and your tax situation benefits from it, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. This allows for tax-deferred growth, and you might be able to deduct contributions from your taxable income depending on your income and participation in other retirement plans.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable brokerage accounts for additional investing. Keep in mind that you will be responsible for capital gains taxes when you sell investments in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This should also reflect how much risk you’re willing to take within each type of account.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different types of accounts come with different tax implications. For instance, interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at preferential rates. Be mindful of where you place income-generating assets.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and as you get closer to retirement, it’s important to review your allocation and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
