Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but provide flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

3. **Investment Horizon**: If you're young and have a long time until retirement, you might allocate more towards stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs for growth. As you age, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, typically by withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then traditional tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), and lastly Roth IRAs.

In general, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach, so it’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal objectives and circumstances.
