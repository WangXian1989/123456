The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering several factors: your current tax situation, your retirement goals, and your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider diversifying your contributions between a traditional and Roth IRA. This allows you to have both tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, providing flexibility in managing your tax burden.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it may make sense to prioritize Roth contributions. Conversely, if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, traditional contributions might be more beneficial.

5. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for shorter-term goals, while reserving retirement accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before maxing out contributions in retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, make sure to review and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and objectives.
