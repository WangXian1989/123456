Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Next, consider funding an IRA to benefit from its tax advantages. After maxing out these tax-advantaged accounts, you can then invest in taxable accounts. Additionally, consider the types of investments in each account based on their tax implications; for example, tax-efficient investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.
