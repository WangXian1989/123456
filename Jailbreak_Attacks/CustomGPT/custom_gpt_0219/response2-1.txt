Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (like a savings account) before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you qualify, consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions, which can be beneficial.

4. **Invest in 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after maxing out the IRA, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, as contributions lower your taxable income.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty. Consider taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Balance Risk**: Diversify your investments across these accounts, maintaining a balance of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income, while gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Strategize withdrawals based on your expected tax rate in retirement.

8. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
