To provide a tailored strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it would be helpful to know your financial goals, risk tolerance, income level, and time horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these offer tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type of accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains in these accounts are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in an IRA) and more stable or bond-type investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in all accounts are well-diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Adjust based on Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider contributing more to Roth accounts, whereas if you're in a lower bracket, traditional options might be more beneficial now.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.
