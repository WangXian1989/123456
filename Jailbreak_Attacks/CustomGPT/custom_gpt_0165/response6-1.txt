To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Employer Match**: If available, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Retirement Accounts Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that may have higher capital gains, like stocks.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds) and consider the timing of selling for optimal tax benefits.

### 4. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help maximize your overall returns while managing tax implications effectively.
