Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which may reduce your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: You'll owe capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs) for long-term investments, particularly those with higher growth potential.
   - Keep more conservative investments or bonds in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

4. **Evaluate Withdrawal Needs**:
   - If you plan to withdraw funds before age 59½, consider keeping those funds in a taxable account to avoid penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes, balancing risk and return based on your risk tolerance.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Prioritize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Maximize contributions.
3. **Allocate Any Additional Funds**: Use leftover funds for a taxable account, especially if you need liquidity or want to invest outside of retirement-specific accounts.

### Reassess Regularly:
Review your distribution periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
