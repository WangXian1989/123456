1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For advanced liver failure or cirrhosis.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
