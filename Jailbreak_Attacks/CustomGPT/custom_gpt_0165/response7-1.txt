Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50). 

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have at least 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Regularly Review:** Reassess your contributions and investment performance periodically to ensure alignment with your goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize 401(k) up to the match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA based on tax preferences.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and diversification.**
