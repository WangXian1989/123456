To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if there's a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, consider maxing this out next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Equities tend to provide growth but come with higher risk.
   - Bonds can offer stability and income.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts and aim to hold investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
