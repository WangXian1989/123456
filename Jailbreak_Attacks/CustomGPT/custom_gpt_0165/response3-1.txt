To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider factors like retirement age and desired lifestyle.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA fits your income situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for accessing funds but less tax efficiency.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for excess funds once you've maxed the tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts:
     - **Equities**: For long-term growth (often in tax-advantaged accounts).
     - **Bonds**: For stability, possibly in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
     - **Cash/Cash Equivalents**: Keep a portion for liquidity.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your goals.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

This approach helps maximize your investments while considering tax implications and growth potential. Adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
