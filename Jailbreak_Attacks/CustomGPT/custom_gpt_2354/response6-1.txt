When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, making them suitable for more short-term goals.

2. **Define Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize maxing out your employer match in a 401(k) and consider IRAs for additional retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity as they allow quicker access to funds without penalties.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to at least obtain any employer match.
- Utilize IRAs for additional tax-advantaged growth, considering the Roth option for potential tax-free income in retirement.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement or for more flexible financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
