Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings or specific goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), and taxes are only paid upon withdrawal (traditional) or tax-free if conditions are met (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains may be subject to capital gains taxes, which can affect your overall returns.

3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - For short-term goals or liquidity needs, prioritize adding funds to your taxable accounts.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Be aware of withdrawal penalties and age restrictions associated with retirement accounts. Ensure you have sufficient funds in your taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
