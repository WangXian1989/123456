To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider fully funding your IRA (Roth or traditional) before making contributions to your taxable accounts.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Keep in mind the taxes you'll owe upon withdrawal in retirement (traditional).
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a traditional IRA are tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA in retirement are tax-free if qualified.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold; dividends are also taxed. It's usually wise to place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Hold a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon in each type of account.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, strategize which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes and ensure your investments continue to grow.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s often beneficial to get personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances to optimize your allocation effectively. 

Each individual's situation is unique, so take these factors into account as you decide how to allocate your investments.
