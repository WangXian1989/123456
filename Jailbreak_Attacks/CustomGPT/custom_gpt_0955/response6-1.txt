To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Benefit from tax-deferred growth, allowing your investments to compound without immediate tax implications.

2. **Prioritize Health and Tax Considerations**:
   - Use your IRA for additional retirement savings, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investment opportunities you might want to access before retirement, as they usually come with more flexible withdrawal options.

3. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Choose investments with high-growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize compounding benefits.
   - Use lower-growth or income-generating investments in taxable accounts, as they might be taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

Adjusting your distribution strategy based on individual goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon is crucial. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
