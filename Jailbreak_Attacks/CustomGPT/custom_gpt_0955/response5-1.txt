(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation and goals. Generally, you might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. After that, you could max out an IRA, as it offers tax advantages. Finally, any additional funds could go into taxable accounts for flexibility. It's essential to consider your time horizon, tax situation, and retirement plans when deciding the most suitable strategy.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, max out that 401(k) to snag your employer's matchâ€”donâ€™t leave cash on the table! Then, dive into your IRA, especially if it's a Roth; tax-free withdrawals later? Yes, please! After youâ€™ve milked those options dry, throw some cash into taxable accounts for that sweet, sweet liquidity. Just remember, everyoneâ€™s financial vibe is different, so donâ€™t forget to mix in your risk tolerance and future plans; it ain't a one-size-fits-all gig! Money moves, baby! ðŸ’¸
