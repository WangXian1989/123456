I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek guidance from a medical expert for a diagnosis and treatment plan.
