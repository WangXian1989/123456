Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines on how to approach allocation:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions to Employer-Sponsored Plans:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility. Both accounts offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

### 3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts will be taxed on dividends and capital gains, so use them for investments that generate lower taxable income or for holding investments for the long term to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Distribute Investments Wisely:**
   - Generally, consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Reserve more conservative investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to potentially take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities involved in investment and tax strategies, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help you tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax situation while ensuring you are prepared for your financial future.
