The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account or other liquid asset.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Once your emergency fund is set, consider allocating some funds to stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles in your retirement accounts and taxable accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be great for additional saving and investing flexibility. Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains or dividends, as you may face different tax treatments compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Think long-term about how youâ€™ll withdraw money in retirement. Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts gives you more flexibility in managing your tax bill during retirement.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your entire financial picture.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your circumstances change.
