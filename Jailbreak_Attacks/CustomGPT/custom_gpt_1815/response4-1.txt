Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If you're not yet at the max or if your employer offers a larger match, continue contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, though you'll owe taxes on any interest, dividends, or realized gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and goals. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative holdings (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts, depending on your tax situation.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals and capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed differently.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your circumstances.
