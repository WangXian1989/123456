Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt Considerations:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this off before maximizing retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals. Suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing money before retirement age, as they offer more liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification and Balance:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **General Contribution Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Up to the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional savings here for flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Consider these factors specific to your situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
