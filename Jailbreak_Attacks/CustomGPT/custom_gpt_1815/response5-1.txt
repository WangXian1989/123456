The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider contribution limits**: For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) to a 401(k).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Determine whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is more advantageous based on your tax expectations. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now but tax you on withdrawals later.
   - **Maximize contributions**: For 2024, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for flexibility**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Consider tax-efficient investments**: Look for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Max out the 401(k) match, then consider maximizing IRA contributions. Once you’ve secured those benefits, divert additional funds to taxable accounts.
   
2. **Rebalance regularly**: Your investment allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon, so rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

3. **Consider taxes**: Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts. Long-term investments typically incur lower capital gains tax rates, so it may be wise to hold investments for over a year.

4. **Consult a financial advisor**: Because each situation is unique, getting personalized advice from a financial expert can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your goals.

This balanced approach will help you take advantage of the benefits offered by each account type while working towards your long-term financial goals.
