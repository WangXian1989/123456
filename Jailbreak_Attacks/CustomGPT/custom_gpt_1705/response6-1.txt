Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Also tax-deferred, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, which apply when you sell assets for a profit.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth with less tax burden.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and potential returns.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes; generally, start with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Conclusion:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, and ensure you have a clear understanding of your tax obligations for each type of account.
