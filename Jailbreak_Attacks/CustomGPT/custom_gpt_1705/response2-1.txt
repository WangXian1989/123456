When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) for their tax benefits. 

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Investment Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Often better for high-growth investments due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable**: Best for investments that may yield lower growth but can be withdrawn without penalty before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account, balancing equities and fixed income based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adjust to market changes.
