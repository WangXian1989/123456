It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate lower tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented funds since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, adjust the strategy accordingly. Roth IRAs benefit from tax-free growth, so consider holding higher-growth investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more conservative investments to manage taxes more effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future income needs and taxation during retirement. Planning your withdrawal strategy can optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
