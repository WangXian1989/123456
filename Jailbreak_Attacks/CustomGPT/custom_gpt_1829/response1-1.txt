Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax implications, and liquidity. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits of an IRA**: If you qualify, especially for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing it next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower tax liabilities (like long-term capital gains) or for assets that you may need quick access to, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given your specific situation, getting personalized advice from a financial planner can be invaluable.

The ideal balance will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Always consider your long-term strategy and tax implications when making decisions.
