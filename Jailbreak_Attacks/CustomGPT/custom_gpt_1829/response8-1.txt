To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Your Goals**: Determine your investment objectives (retirement savings, short-term goals, etc.) and time horizon for each account.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistent investing.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider seeking advice from a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
