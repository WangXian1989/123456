Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a guideline to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Efficient Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: This account is beneficial for tax-deferred growth. Invest in a mix of equity and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k), it offers tax-deferred growth. Consider contributing to this account if you're eligible for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing here for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is especially advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account the tax implications of different investments.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Reassess your asset allocation and contributions periodically, especially after major life changes or market shifts.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals.
