To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of additional tax benefits. Choose a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Allocate Taxable Investments Wisely**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income, like index funds or tax-managed funds. Consider municipal bonds, which are often tax-exempt.
   - **Real Estate & Alternative Investments**: If applicable, consider holding real estate investments in taxable accounts as they can provide rental income, often taxed at lower rates. 

3. **Review Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing Across Accounts**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio. This ensures that your risk level remains consistent and takes advantage of market fluctuations.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals, taking into account age and retirement plans. Usually, 401(k) and IRA distributions during retirement can be strategically managed for tax efficiency.
