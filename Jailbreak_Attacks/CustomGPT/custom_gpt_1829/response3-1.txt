When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may reduce your taxable income. Employer matching can enhance returns.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for flexibility; subjects you to capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, desired lifestyle, and specific savings targets.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your investment growth over time.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the match, consider funding an IRA (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance. This helps manage risk and maximize potential returns.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances and objectives.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can optimize tax advantages and work towards your financial goals effectively.
