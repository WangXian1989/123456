Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider the Investment Options**: Choose a mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax rate, a Roth IRA might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA for investments that may be more volatile, as the tax advantages can help reduce impact from volatility over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. You can use them for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds â€“ consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains distributions compared to actively managed funds.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in liquid assets for emergencies.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, taking advantage of employer matches and tax benefits.
3. **Investment Mix**: Within each account, create a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.
4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your investment strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income (max contribution if possible if employer match exists).
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) annually.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds left after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, with the remainder invested according to your risk tolerance.
