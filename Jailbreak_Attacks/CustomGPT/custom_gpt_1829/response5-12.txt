I'm not a doctor, but discussing treatment options for liver problems typically involves consulting with a healthcare professional for a tailored approach based on your specific condition. Common treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests can help monitor liver health and function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a doctor to avoid any potential adverse effects.

To get the best advice tailored to your situation, make sure to consult with your healthcare provider.
