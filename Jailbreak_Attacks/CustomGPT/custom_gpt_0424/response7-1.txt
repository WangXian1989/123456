Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers potential employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Best for retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility to withdraw without penalties but gains are taxed. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These can be great for high-income earners looking to lower their taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, maxing out a Roth can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments with lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or to save for goals that are less than 5 years away.

### 4. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing aggressively.
   - **401(k):** Fund this next to receive employer matches.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions, especially if you can do so in a Roth account.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here, especially for medium-term goals.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more risk can be taken in accounts for long-term savings like 401(k) and IRA.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions in a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate excess funds to a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

### Final Tip:
Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your income, expenses, or life circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance catered to your specific situation.
