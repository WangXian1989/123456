To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Summary Overview
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these offer tax benefits.
2. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced allocation across all accounts, based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Detailed Comparative Analysis
- **401(k)**:
  - **Contribution Limits**: Higher limits compared to IRAs.
  - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
  - **Employer Match**: Take full advantage if available.

- **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax; tax-free withdrawals.
  - **Contribution Limits**: Lower than 401(k), but offers flexibility in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - **Liquidity**: Easier access to funds without penalties.
  - **Tax Implications**: Capital gains taxes apply on profits when sold.
  - **Investment Flexibility**: No limits on contributions or withdrawals.

### Recommendations
- **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, choose between Traditional or Roth IRAs.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Invest excess funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Final Thoughts
- **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors may favor growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might opt for more conservative assets.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

This balanced approach can help maximize your savings while minimizing taxes over the long term.
