I’m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. However, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or diuretics for liver cirrhosis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Avoidance of Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health. Avoid exposure to harmful substances.

5. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsies or even liver transplants may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan.
