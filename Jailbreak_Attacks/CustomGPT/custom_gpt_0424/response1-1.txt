Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

### 3. **Back to the 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you need access to before retirement without penalties. This can include investments that generate lower capital gains or dividend taxes.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Aim for a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and optimize growth. You might adjust the focus based on tax implications: for example, holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Reassessment**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Considerations:
- **Age:** Younger investors may lean more heavily into equities for growth, while older investors might shift to more stable, income-generating investments.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align your asset allocation with your comfort level regarding market fluctuations.
