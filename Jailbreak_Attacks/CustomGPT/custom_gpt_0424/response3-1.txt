When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-advantaged, employer-sponsored retirement account. Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)). Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Individual retirement accounts offering tax benefits. Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially in pre-tax options to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider using index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Invest more actively in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth investments, as taxes will be deferred or avoided.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower turnover, or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors can lean more heavily into stocks for growth, while older investors might prefer bonds for stability.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If youâ€™re unsure about your investment strategy, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Early Career:** Focus on maxing out the 401(k) (e.g., 15% of income), then contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible), and lastly invest in a taxable account.
- **Mid to Late Career:** Continue maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while gradually increasing taxable investments as income and savings grow.

### Regular Review:
- Revisit your allocations periodically (at least annually) as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution and take full advantage of tax benefits, contributing to a more secure financial future.
