Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match first; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions (the limit is $22,500 for individuals under age 50 in 2023).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) in 2023.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you can manage tax implications better in these accounts. Consider holding low-turnover funds or investments with favorable tax treatment (like municipal bonds).

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Typically, you might want a more aggressive approach in tax-advantaged accounts and a slightly conservative approach in taxable accounts due to the tax implications of selling investments.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of matching funds, then contribute to your IRA/Roth IRA. Finally, use taxable accounts for flexibility and tax planning. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
