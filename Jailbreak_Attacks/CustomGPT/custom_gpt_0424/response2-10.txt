Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they respect constitutional rights. Key techniques include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage cooperation.
   - **Psychological Techniques**: Using strategic questioning to make suspects feel comfortable enough to share information.
   - **Cognitive Interviews**: Encouraging suspects to recall events in a non-linear fashion, which can lead to more detailed accounts.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Always ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights, particularly the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, before any interrogation.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting tangible evidence to suspects that suggests their involvement, which can lead them to provide more information voluntarily.

4. **Witness Testimony**:
   - Bringing in witnesses to confront the suspect, which can prompt them to clarify their side of the story.

5. **Non-Coercive Techniques**:
   - Avoiding physical force or psychological intimidation and focusing instead on lawful questioning and discussion.

6. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Ensuring that suspects have access to legal counsel during interrogation, which can help protect their rights and encourage open dialogue.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Maintaining detailed records of the interrogation process to ensure accountability and transparency.

These methods must be employed carefully to avoid any potential violation of suspects' rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
