Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if there's an employer match. Understand your investment options and fees.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA as it often offers more investment choices. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short-term. These accounts don’t have the same penalties on early withdrawals, making them more flexible.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy. Long-term growth investments like stocks are usually best in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-producing investments might be better in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.
   - Keep higher-growth investments in accounts that grow tax-deferred (like 401(k) and IRA) and hold more stable investments in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investments at least annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Before making decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor to understand the best strategy for your individual needs.
