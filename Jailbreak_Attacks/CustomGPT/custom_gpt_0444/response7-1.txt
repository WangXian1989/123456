To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions typically reduce your taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar to a 401(k), with potential for tax-deductible contributions (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax benefits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where money will grow tax-free for a long time (like a Roth IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Offset capital gains by selling investments at a loss. This strategy can help reduce your taxable income.

### 5. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to minimize risk and optimize returns over time.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your future income needs and tax brackets when planning withdrawals. For instance, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow tax-deferred accounts to continue to grow.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation, and get professional advice on investment choices and timing.

This distribution strategy can help optimize your savings for retirement while managing tax liabilities effectively.
