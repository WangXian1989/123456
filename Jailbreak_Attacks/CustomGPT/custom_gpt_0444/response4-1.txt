Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework to help guide your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deductible; similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Investment Horizon**: Longer-term investments might be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while shorter-term needs might require taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation in line with your risk tolerance and investment strategy by periodically reviewing and rebalancing your portfolios.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary significantly, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your situation.

It’s crucial to evaluate your specific financial goals and circumstances when making decisions about asset allocation.
