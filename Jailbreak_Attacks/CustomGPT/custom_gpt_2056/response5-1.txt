When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

2. **Diversify Investments**: Inside your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), choose a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

3. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**: Be aware of withdrawal rules and penalties for 401(k)s and IRAs; generally, these accounts are meant for long-term growth. Use taxable accounts for more flexible access to funds.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains benefits.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals, especially as tax laws and your personal situation may change.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
