To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, and capital gains are taxed when you sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds across various asset classes in all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you intend to take withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors might favor growth in taxable accounts for flexibility, while those closer to retirement may want to focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for savings.

6. **Annual Review**: Reassess your allocations and contributions annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your personal financial situation and retirement goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize tax benefits while preparing for retirement.
