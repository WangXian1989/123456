I’m not a doctor, but it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition and its severity. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery. Please seek medical advice to discuss your symptoms and treatment options.
