To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, affecting your overall tax burden.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your primary financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and the time horizon for each.
   - Risk tolerance should guide how aggressively you invest within each account type.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the maximum annual contribution limits to your 401(k) and IRAs, and prioritize contributions to employer-matched 401(k) plans first.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on each account's purpose and tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw from each account, especially considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional retirement accounts.

Itâ€™s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your unique financial situation and goals.
