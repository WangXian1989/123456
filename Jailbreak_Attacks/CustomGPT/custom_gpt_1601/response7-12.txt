I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general options often considered for liver issues. Treatment options may depend on the specific liver problem, its severity, and the underlying cause. Here are some commonly considered options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some supplements, like milk thistle, are sometimes recommended for liver health, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare professional.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In more severe cases, medical interventions like endoscopic procedures or procedures to manage varices or ascites may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be considered as a last resort.

It's critical to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They will take into account your medical history, the specifics of the liver condition, and any other ongoing treatments. 

For personalized advice and treatment, please consult a doctor.
