The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, consider fully funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for the tax benefits.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for IRAs.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts (like a traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA) allow for tax-deferred growth but taxes will be paid upon withdrawal. Conversely, Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Review the investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus what you can access in an IRA or taxable account. Choose a mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Maintain Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility but much less tax efficiency. They may be suitable for short-term goals or if you want easier access to your funds without penalties.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Review your distribution and investment strategy periodically to ensure it still aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If in doubt, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing your tax liability.
