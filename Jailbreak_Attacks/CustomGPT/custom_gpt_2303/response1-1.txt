Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to the match level. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you're close to retirement and can afford to do so.

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor a Roth IRA.
   - A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now; consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement, such as an emergency fund or short-term savings goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets here to minimize capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you're diversifying within each type of account. Different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) can reduce risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors often take more risks with their portfolios, while those closer to retirement generally shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your allocation as necessary.

Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
