Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to maximize this benefit first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Depending on your tax situation, prioritize your contributions to a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after reaching your 401(k) match. You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - Be mindful of the income limits for Roth IRA contributions and the tax deduction limits for traditional IRAs if you or your spouse have a workplace retirement plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting excess savings into a taxable investment account.
   - In taxable accounts, itâ€™s wise to focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment strategy (growth vs. value).

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - Keep in mind capital gains taxes for taxable accounts, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of your investments.
