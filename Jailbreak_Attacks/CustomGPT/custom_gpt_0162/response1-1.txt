To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions might be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are post-tax investments. While you pay taxes on the dividends and capital gains, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. 
   - Young investors may lean towards a more aggressive portfolio in 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might prefer more conservative investments as retirement approaches.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to minimize risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain a separate emergency fund before investing heavily in these accounts, aiming for 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically to adjust for changing market conditions and life events.

It could be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
