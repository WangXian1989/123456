(🔒Normal Output) When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match since this is essentially “free money.” Afterward, you can consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-free growth in retirement. Finally, any additional investments can go into taxable accounts, where you have more flexibility but must consider capital gains taxes. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan.
