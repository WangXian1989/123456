Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves understanding several key factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match up to the maximum limit. This is essentially free money and beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.
   
2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains, as taxes are due more frequently. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or stocks that pay qualified dividends.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may prioritize bond investments to reduce risk.

Overall, the key to effective distribution is to maintain a balance that aligns with your long-term financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency. Regularly review your allocations to adapt to changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
