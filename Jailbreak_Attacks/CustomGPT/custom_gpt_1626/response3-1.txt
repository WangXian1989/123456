To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your long-term and short-term financial objectives (retirement, home purchase, education, etc.).

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages, with options like Traditional or Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax, but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Allocate According to Tax Efficiency**:
   - **High-Cost Assets in Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), IRA):
     - Place investments that may generate high taxes, like bonds and actively managed funds.
   - **Low-Cost Assets in Taxable Accounts**:
     - Hold index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - If eligible, contribute to an IRA; consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) that fits your risk tolerance within each account.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your investments frequently to adjust for changes in market conditions or personal situations.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're uncertain, consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance based on your specific situation.

By distributing your investments strategically, you can enhance tax efficiency and align your investments with your financial objectives.
