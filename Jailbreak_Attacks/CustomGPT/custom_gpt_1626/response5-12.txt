I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly procedures, depending on the specific liver condition.

Here are some general treatment options that can be discussed with your doctor:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a balanced diet to support liver health, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight to reduce liver fat.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit consumption of medications that may harm the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Specific medications can help manage liver conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
   - Diuretics may be prescribed for conditions causing fluid retention.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.
   - Regular monitoring and check-ups to assess liver function and progression of the disease.

Always follow your doctor's advice for the most appropriate treatment for your situation.
