The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans (401(k)):**
   - If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement. If you prefer the tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA may be suitable.

3. **Assess tax implications:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, whereas Roth contributions are after-tax but grow tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

4. **Diversify investments:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), considering your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider your time horizon:**
   - If retirement is far off, you might allocate more to stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs for higher growth potential, while keeping some safer investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance regularly:**
   - Review your allocations annually or semi-annually and adjust based on changes in market conditions and your personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a financial advisor:**
   - Every situation is unique. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific needs.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your individual goals and circumstances.
