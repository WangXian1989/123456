To optimize your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Strategically take withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA to minimize your tax liability.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
