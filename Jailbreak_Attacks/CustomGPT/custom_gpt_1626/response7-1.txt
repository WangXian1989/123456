It's essential to have a well-thought-out strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) unless you have high-interest debt or other immediate financial needs. This will help take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs have tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: The choice between contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can depend on your current tax rate versus your anticipated tax rate in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be advantageous as it offers immediate tax deductions.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Only invest in taxable accounts after you have fully funded any tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax benefits and may generate capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Consider holding higher-growth investments in these accounts, as you wonâ€™t pay taxes on growth until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is also suitable for higher-growth investments since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for holding more conservative investments and tax-efficient funds, like index funds, to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: These are general strategies, and it's beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

Make sure to continuously monitor your investments and adjust your strategy as needed based on market conditions, financial goals, and changes in your personal situation.
