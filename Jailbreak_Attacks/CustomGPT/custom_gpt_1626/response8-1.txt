The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit or at least enough to get the full employer match. If your company offers a Roth 401(k) option, consider whether after-tax contributions may be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement (Traditional) or want tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Assess your current and projected tax situation. Tax-advantaged accounts can provide significant tax benefits, so prioritize contributions based on your tax strategy.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk. Different accounts can hold different asset classes.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable. A financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so it's essential to consider your own goals and circumstances when making these decisions.
