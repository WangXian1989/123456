To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), ensure you contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts. For 2023, the annual contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Pre-tax accounts (401(k))**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment gains are taxed annually, but you have more flexibility in access. 

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth investments, as you wonâ€™t pay taxes on dividends or capital gains until withdrawal (or at all for a Roth IRA).
   - Use your taxable account for investments that generate lower turnover or qualify for long-term capital gains tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow at different rates, regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a savings account or other liquid assets.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and understanding the tax implications of each account type, you can optimize your overall investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
