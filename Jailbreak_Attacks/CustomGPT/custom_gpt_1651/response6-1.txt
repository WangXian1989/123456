When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors, such as your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some steps to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA to potentially receive a tax deduction.

2. **Evaluate Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For funds needed within the next 5 years, consider prioritizing taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings with tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be more suitable for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Dividends and Interest**: Holding these in tax-advantaged accounts can help defer taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Stock vs. Bonds**: Decide on an asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance. More aggressive growth (stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (bonds) could be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset distribution annually to adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

By focusing on tax advantages, investment goals, and tax implications, you can create a strategy that maximizes your investment potential across all account types.
