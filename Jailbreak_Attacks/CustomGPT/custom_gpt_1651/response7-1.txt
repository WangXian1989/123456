Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.” Contributing up to the maximum allowed limit can be advantageous because contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax strategy). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, minimizing your taxable income through pre-tax contributions (like those to a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) can be beneficial.
   - Roth accounts, while not providing immediate tax benefits, can be advantageous in retirement if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts are best suited for long-term investments, often in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - In taxable accounts, you might consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - If you are decades away from retirement, you may want to adopt a more aggressive investment strategy. As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to protect your savings. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation across all accounts, and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired level of risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help you optimize your investment strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution of your investments depends heavily on your individual circumstances. Keep your goals, time horizon, and tax implications in mind as you make your decisions.
