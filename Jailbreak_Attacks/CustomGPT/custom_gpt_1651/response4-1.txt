Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.
   - Investment choices are typically limited, but consider diversifying within those options (stocks, bonds, etc.).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - The choice between a Traditional and Roth IRA should be based on your current versus expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest in a taxable account for money you may need before retirement or to take advantage of investments that provide favorable tax treatment.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, which typically have lower capital gains distributions.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments for capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize contributions based on employer matches and tax benefits.
   - Maintain some liquidity in a taxable account for short-term needs or opportunities.
   - Balance your investments across accounts to maintain desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every financial situation is unique, and a professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By carefully considering your time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax implications, you can develop a strategy that maximizes growth while aligning with your financial goals.
