4. **Peer Influencers**: Collaborate with trusted figures and influencers within the youth community who can authentically advocate for your message.

5. **Interactive Content**: Use polls, quizzes, and challenges to engage them and make it fun to learn about issues and candidates.

6. **Clear Information**: Provide straightforward, accessible information on voting processes, including how to register and vote.
