I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Liver treatments depend on the specific condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet, low in sodium and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular visits to a healthcare provider for blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but always consult a doctor before trying them.

Please consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
