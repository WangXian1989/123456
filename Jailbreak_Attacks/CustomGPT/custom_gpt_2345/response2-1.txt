Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after getting the match. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs (if you can), consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility, such as the ability to withdraw funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of investments (stocks, bonds, funds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but consider using this account for investments with high growth potential since withdrawals will be tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investments and rebalance to align with your goals. Consider your tax situation each year to determine the best places for new contributions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given individual circumstances can vary widely, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

By focusing on these principles, you can create an effective distribution plan for your finances.
