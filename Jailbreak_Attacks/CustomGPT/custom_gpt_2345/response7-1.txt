Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to get any employer matching funds, as it's essentially "free money."
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Advantages**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
- **Contribution Limits**: Know the annual limits ($6,500 for individuals, $7,500 if age 50 or older as of 2023).
- **Diversification**: Use IRAs for a mix of investments since you have more flexibility than in a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts are not tax-advantaged but allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for short-term goals or emergency savings.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.**
2. **Max out your IRA, choosing Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.**
3. **Next, contribute to your taxable account for additional savings and flexibility.**

### **Regular Review**
- Rebalance your portfolio regularly to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- For personalized advice based on your situation, it's wise to consult a financial advisor. 

This approach balances immediate tax benefits and long-term growth potential while considering accessibility to funds.
