When distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt first. Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can go into tax-deferred accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments with favorable long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on market conditions and your changing goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts first, then 401(k), and finally Roth IRAs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can offer personalized insights tailored to your situation.
