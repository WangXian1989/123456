Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's free money! Consider contributing the maximum if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant, especially in a Roth IRA if you're eligible.

2. **Consider Your Tax situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA** contributions reduce your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth accounts** (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement. They provide flexibility in withdrawals and don’t have contribution limits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that fits your specific circumstances.
