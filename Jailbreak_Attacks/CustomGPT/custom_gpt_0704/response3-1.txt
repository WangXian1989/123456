Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth can be beneficial.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual limits for both 401(k) and IRA contributions. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. Keep stocks or index funds in taxable accounts, as they benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risk. Consider your overall asset allocation strategy (e.g., stocks vs. bonds) to align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation. Changes in market conditions may shift your asset allocation over time.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best approach, consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
