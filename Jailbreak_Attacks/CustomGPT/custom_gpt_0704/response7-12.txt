I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition you've been diagnosed with. Here are a few potential approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications (reducing sugar, fats, and salt), regular exercise, and quitting alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Some conditions benefit from vitamin supplements or specific diets designed to support liver function.

4. **Procedures/Surgery**: In severe cases, options may include procedures to remove bile duct obstructions or even liver transplantation if the liver is severely damaged.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
