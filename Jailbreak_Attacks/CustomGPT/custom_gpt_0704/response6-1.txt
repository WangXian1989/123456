Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawal flexibility in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

3. **Consider Your Withdrawals**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, prefer taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your asset mix aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, not just in individual ones.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to maintain your target based on performance and changing financial goals. 

A tailored approach considering your circumstances will yield the best results, so consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial.
