Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA as it provides tax advantages. Depending on your income, you may be able to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth) upon withdrawal. This can help reduce your taxable income now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth, depending on future tax rates).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer the same tax advantages. However, they allow for more flexible access to funds and can be beneficial for short-term needs.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). Invest for long-term growth or stability based on your risk tolerance.
   - For shorter-term goals, such as buying a home, it may be wise to keep more funds liquid in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of assets across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other securities can be allocated differently based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your investments and adjust according to changes in financial goals, market conditions, or significant life events.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the max employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum annually.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any surplus funds for more flexible investing, focusing on less tax-inefficient assets (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

### Final Consideration
Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal financial situation and goals.
