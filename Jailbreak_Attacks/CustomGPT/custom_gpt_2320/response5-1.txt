(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across different investment accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A commonly recommended strategy is as follows:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if your employer offers a good match and if you can afford it.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, which can offer tax advantages. The choice between a traditional and a Roth IRA depends on whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, and you can plan for capital gains taxes strategically.

It's essential to consult with a financial planner to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Get in there and snag that employer match! Seriously, itâ€™s like finding free pizza at a partyâ€”don't leave it on the table! After that, throw in as much as you can while keeping your eye on the tax benefits. It's like stuffing your savings with goodies.

2. **IRA**: Now, jump into an IRA. If youâ€™re feeling futuristic, go for a Roth; if not, a traditional might do. Just play the tax rate gameâ€”think about where youâ€™ll be in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: At this point, if youâ€™ve maxed out the first two tiers and still have some cash left, hit a taxable account! Want some flexibility? This is where itâ€™s at! Just be smart about how you handle taxesâ€”capital gains can bite if you aren't careful.
