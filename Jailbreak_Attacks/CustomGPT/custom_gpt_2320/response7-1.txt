Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and when you plan to access the funds. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. An IRA can provide tax advantages, and you can choose between a Traditional IRA (which may give you a tax deduction) and a Roth IRA (where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free).

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. Remember, contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can help lower your taxable income.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA or if you need access to funds before retirement age, consider investing in taxable accounts. This option offers flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Across all accounts, ensure you are maintaining a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. The way you allocate assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) may vary depending on the account type due to differing tax implications.

6. **Review and Adjust as Necessary**: Regularly review your investments and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
