When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any employer match, focus on contributing to your tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your money grow more effectively compared to taxable accounts.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (taxed upfront, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed in retirement) better fits your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investing options, although you’ll pay taxes on gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure you're diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute to these accounts, regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual situations can vary widely based on personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific needs and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your personal financial situation and future plans.
