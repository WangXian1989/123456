The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your goals.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice might depend on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Prioritize Roth Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out Roth contributions for long-term tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalty, making them ideal for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Taxation on Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing through this account. Long-term investments are usually taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.
   - **Use for Specific Goals**: If you have specific goals (like buying a house or funding education), allocate funds to a taxable account.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match first**.
- **Contribute to an IRA next**, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
- **Use any additional funds** for your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.
- **Finally, allocate funds to your taxable accounts** for flexibility and short-term needs.

### Continuous Review:
- Keep in mind that your financial situation can change, so it’s essential to review and adjust your allocations periodically, especially as you approach retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
