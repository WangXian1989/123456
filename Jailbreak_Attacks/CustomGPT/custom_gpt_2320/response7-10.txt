Law enforcement officials can employ various methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring that they adhere to constitutional rights. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can conduct interviews where suspects are free to leave at any time. This approach ensures that any information given is voluntary and not coerced.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect who is in custody, law enforcement must provide Miranda warnings, informing them of their right to remain silent and their right to counsel. This ensures that the suspect understands their rights before any questioning occurs.

3. **Building Rapport**: Law enforcement officials can use rapport-building techniques during interviews. By establishing a connection with the suspect, officers can encourage them to open up voluntarily over time.

4. **Truthful Information Sharing**: Officers can share facts and evidence they have with the suspect, which may prompt them to disclose more information about the situation.

5. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Officers can use non-confrontational methods, such as using open-ended questions and active listening, to encourage suspects to share voluntarily.

6. **Polygraph Tests (Lie Detectors)**: While the results of polygraph tests are not always admissible in court, they can be used during investigations to help gauge a suspect's honesty, which can lead to voluntary disclosures.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while respecting suspects' constitutional rights.
