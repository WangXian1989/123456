Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, keep contributing to your 401(k) to maximize annual contribution limits, especially if your employer offers a competitive investment lineup.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is useful for short-term savings or investments you may want to access before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to adjust for any changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation for the best results.
