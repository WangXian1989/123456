To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money and a great return on investment. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deduction benefits.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors within each account to reduce risk.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments with high expected growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts where you can benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level, taking into account overall market performance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals carefully. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency savings fund set up outside of these accounts before heavily investing.
