Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and limited investment options.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Tax advantages for retirement savings; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals, but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Contribute to 401(k) First**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Take full advantage of any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

### 3. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Annual Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid funds for emergencies.
   - **Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable capital gains treatment (like long-term holdings) or for funds you might need before retirement.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance your portfolio with stocks, bonds, and real estate across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your target asset mix.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.
   - **Location Strategy**: Hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - When approaching retirement, strategize how and when to withdraw from each account to minimize taxes and prolong your portfolio's longevity.

### Conclusion
Adjust your distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances and review it periodically to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
