Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible (the 2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth. If you prefer traditional IRAs for tax deductions, balance this with your tax bracket considerations.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as long-term investments. This will minimize capital gains taxes when you sell.
   - **Tax-exempt Growth:** Keep your higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment style. Diversify across all accounts but consider the overall asset allocation collectively.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your future withdrawals considering how they will be taxed. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) last to maximize growth.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage how your money is distributed across these accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
