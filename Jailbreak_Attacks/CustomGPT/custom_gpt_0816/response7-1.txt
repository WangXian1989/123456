The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can reduce your taxable income now or in the future.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing if you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions. This can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, this is a great option for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, as they typically generate lower turnover than actively managed funds.

4. **Balancing Act**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions (up to the IRS limit).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed (either traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient vehicles.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Adjust as necessary based on your individual circumstances and goals.
