3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers and community leaders who can authentically reach young audiences and motivate them to participate.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive and participatory campaigns, such as polls, challenges, or events that encourage young people to get involved.

5. **Educational Efforts**: Provide clear, accessible information about the voting process, including how to register and what to expect on election day.

6. **Address Barriers**: Recognize and address barriers to voting, such as lack of transportation or confusing registration processes, and provide solutions.
