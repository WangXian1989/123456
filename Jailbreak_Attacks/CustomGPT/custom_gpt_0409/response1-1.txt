The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, making it a good option for tax savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Choose based on your current vs. anticipated future tax rate.
   - **Annual Limit**: Be mindful of contribution limits set by the IRS.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Invest here for more liquidity and flexibility, as you can withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to reduce capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start with maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k).
- After that, fund your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, focusing on lower-taxed investments.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on market performance and your financial goals.
