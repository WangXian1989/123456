Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider your IRA options:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; tax is paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free during retirement.

3. **Maximize Contributions**: Try to maximize your contributions to all accounts:
   - For 2023, the maximum 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional savings to a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance. Consider allocating more stocks in taxable accounts (due to lower capital gains taxes) and bonds in tax-deferred accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Reevaluate Annually**: Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your unique situation.
