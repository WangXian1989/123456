To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals or potential tax-free growth.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.

2. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Asset allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance, age, and retirement goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Rebalance periodically:** Review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your long-term financial goals and risk profile.

3. **Contribution Limits Awareness:**
   - **Be mindful of contribution limits:** Ensure you're making the most of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRA limits).
   - **Catch-up contributions:** If you're 50 or older, take advantage of catch-up contributions to boost your retirement savings.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for withdrawals strategically:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement to minimize tax burdens.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your financial portfolio to better meet your retirement objectives. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
