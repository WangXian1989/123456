When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which allow for tax-deferred growth. This can be especially beneficial if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement.
   - If you have a Roth IRA option, consider contributing to it for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but balance it with your immediate tax situation.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are typically $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50).

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, due to their tax advantages.
   - In your taxable accounts, consider keeping investments that may produce more taxable income (like bonds or certain stock funds) or investments with a long-term growth focus to benefit from capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts prematurely.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
