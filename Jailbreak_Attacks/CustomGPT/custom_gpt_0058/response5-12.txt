I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that common treatment options for liver problems often include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgery or liver transplants, depending on the severity. Itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

If you have specific symptoms or conditions, let me know, and I can provide more tailored information!
