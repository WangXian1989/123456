Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general tips:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This can help you take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need in the short term or to achieve specific goals, as they offer flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
