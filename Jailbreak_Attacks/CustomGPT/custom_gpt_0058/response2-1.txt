Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or to include investments that benefit from favorable capital gains rates and tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and goals. Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, it's always best to consult a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively!
