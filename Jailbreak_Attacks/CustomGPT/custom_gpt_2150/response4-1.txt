Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Ideal for higher earners or those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your anticipated future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or if you want access to funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Long-Term Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, then use taxable accounts for more flexible, short-to-medium-term needs.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
