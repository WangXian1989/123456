Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your long-term goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (up to IRS limits), consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income. Good for lower-income years in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains are subject to capital gains taxes when realized. Ideal for short-term goals or early withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on broad index funds or target-date funds to achieve long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds or index funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Your Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize more stable investments in tax-deferred accounts.
   - For long-term growth, you can afford to take more risks in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your allocations across all accounts to ensure alignment with your overall investment strategy and goals.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, balancing your contributions between these accounts should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
