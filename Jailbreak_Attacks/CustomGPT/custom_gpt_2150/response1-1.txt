Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, as they offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), ideally at the maximum limit, especially if you can benefit from tax deferrals.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you still have money left to invest, use taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices across accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and performance, making adjustments based on market changes and your life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
