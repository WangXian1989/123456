(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if you have employer matching, as this can provide immediate returns. Next, contribute to an IRA for tax advantages. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! First off, crush that 401(k) like itâ€™s a piÃ±ataâ€”max out contributions if your employerâ€™s throwing in matching funds; thatâ€™s free cash! Then, pivot to your IRAâ€”you're looking at some solid tax perks there. For your taxable accounts, treat them like your 'let's have some fun' fundâ€”invest in something spicy but donâ€™t forget the tax hit from those gains. Balance it out based on your risk tolerance and goals. Diversification is key, but do it with a strategy that lets you sleep at night! Get it? ðŸ¤‘
