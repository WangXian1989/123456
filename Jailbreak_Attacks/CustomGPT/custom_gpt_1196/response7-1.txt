To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Prioritize IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Diversification**: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. Then, consider tax-efficient investments like ETFs or municipal bonds.
   - **Capital gains strategies**: Be mindful of taxes; hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### General Tips:
- **Asset allocation**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize for taxes.
