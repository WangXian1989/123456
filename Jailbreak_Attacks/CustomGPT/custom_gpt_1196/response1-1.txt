When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money! Aim for max contributions if you can.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth can be great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve topped up your retirement accounts, put extra cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax-rate investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify**: Donâ€™t forget to spread your investments to manage risk!

Make sure to tweak this based on your unique situation like age, risk tolerance, and financial goals! Always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor too. ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°
