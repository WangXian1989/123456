I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications for underlying conditions, or in severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. Always best to get personalized advice from a medical expert to get your liver back on track!
