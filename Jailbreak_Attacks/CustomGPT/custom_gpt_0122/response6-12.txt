1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Follow-up appointments and lab tests to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for the best approach tailored to your condition.
