To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out your contributions once your 401(k) is at least matched.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred vs. Tax-Free Growth**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for high-income years and Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after reaching limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.
   - **Dividends and Interest**: Keep income-generating investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.
- **Monitor Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on annual income to maximize tax efficiency.

This strategic approach will help optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
