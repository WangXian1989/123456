To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often offer more investment options than a typical 401(k).

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Prioritize assets that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Taxable accounts are best for long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Keep in mind your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your plans.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
