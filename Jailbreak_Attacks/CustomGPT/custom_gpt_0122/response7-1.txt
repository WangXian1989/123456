Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your tax bracket and withdrawal plans in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or holding investments long-term to benefit from capital gains rates).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider putting higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Update your distribution strategy based on your retirement plan, needing to factor in required minimum distributions (RMDs) for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can offer tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.

Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals.
