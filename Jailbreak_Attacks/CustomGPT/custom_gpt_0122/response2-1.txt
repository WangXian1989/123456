To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these provide tax benefits. Aim for the maximum contribution limits.

2. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Traditional IRAs can offer upfront tax deductions.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where capital gains won't be taxed until withdrawal. Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your future withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, allowing tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Fees and Expenses:**
   - Factor in any fees associated with your accounts and choose low-cost investment options when possible.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary, so consider professional advice for tailored strategies.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and maintaining a balanced allocation, you can optimize your investment strategy and enhance long-term growth.
