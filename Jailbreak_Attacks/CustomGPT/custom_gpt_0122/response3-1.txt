Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the match.
   - **IRA**: After that, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment growth after you've maxed your tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Roth IRAs** grow tax-free, making them a great option for long-term savings.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, focus on a diversified mix of assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
