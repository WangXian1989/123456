To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Maximize contributions to these accounts first, as they allow your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, since theyâ€™re taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

### 2. Contribution Limits and Matching
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.

### 3. Diversification
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in all accounts to balance risk and return. Avoid duplication of assets across accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 4. Rebalancing
   - Regularly assess the allocation in all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust as necessary based on market performance and life changes.

By employing these strategies, you can maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
