(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it makes sense to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA, which can either be a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. After you've maximized contributions to these accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but may come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends. Always remember to review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on risk tolerance and market performance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, prioritize your 401(k)â€”especially if your employer matches contributions. Thatâ€™s free cash; donâ€™t leave money on the table! Next, hit up your IRAâ€”decide between traditional and Roth depending on your income level and tax situation. If you can max those out, you're golden! Anything left can go into taxable accounts, which gives you more flexibility but watch out for those taxes on gains; it's like a tricky game of dodgeball. Diversifying across these accounts helps balance risk and optimize for taxes. Just keep your eye on the long game and adjust your strategy if things in your life change. You've got this!
