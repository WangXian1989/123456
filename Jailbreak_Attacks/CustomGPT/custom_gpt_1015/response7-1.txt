To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that before allocating funds elsewhere. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) due to their tax benefits. If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions ($30,000 if age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Stay within these limits.

4. **Assess Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to IRAs and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment choices, you might prefer to direct more funds towards IRAs or taxable accounts, especially if you can invest in a broader range of assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts to avoid liquidating investments when you need cash.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By employing these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your money for both growth and tax efficiency.
