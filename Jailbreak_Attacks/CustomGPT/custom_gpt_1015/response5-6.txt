First, it's crucial to utilize digital platforms where they spend most of their time, such as social media (Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat). Engaging contentâ€”like videos, memes, and relatable postsâ€”can capture their attention. Additionally, addressing issues that matter to them, like climate change, education affordability, and social justice, can help build a meaningful connection. Collaborating with influencers or trusted figures in their communities can also enhance credibility and reach. Finally, creating opportunities for young people to participate in the political process, such as online forums, webinars, or community events, can mobilize them to engage actively.
