The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility in accessing funds and managing capital gains taxes. However, earnings in these accounts are subject to taxes annually. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that off before investing heavily in any account. Reducing debt can yield better returns than most investments in the long run.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account outside of your retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, stocks are considered a long-term growth investment, while bonds are often used for stability.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Consider your strategy for withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can be tapped first without penalties, while retirement accounts may have restrictions.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, consulting a financial advisor can greatly help in tailoring a strategy that suits your specific needs and goals.

Consider these points carefully and adjust based on your personal financial situation.
