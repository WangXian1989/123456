To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Roth)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns (interest, dividends, and capital gains) are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider how often you will need to access these funds.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - For 401(k): $22,500 (2023) or $30,000 if over 50.
   - For IRA: $6,500 (2023) or $7,500 if over 50.
   - Taxable accounts have no limits but ensure sufficient liquidity.

3. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your timeline for accessing funds:
   - If retirement is far off, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs).
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to the cash.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds).
   - Allocate stock investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to maximize that benefit before directing funds elsewhere.

6. **Consider Your Overall Financial Goals**: Tailor your distribution strategy to align with your personal financial objectives, risk tolerance, and retirement plans.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on individual circumstances, including income level, retirement plans, and risk tolerance. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
