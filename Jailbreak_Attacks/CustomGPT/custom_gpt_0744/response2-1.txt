The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a common strategy that many investors consider:

1. **Max out Employer's 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two depends on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Beyond the Match**: If you still have the capacity to save after contributing to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions to your 401(k) reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable investment accounts. Here, you’ll have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategies**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash equivalents) based on your risk tolerance and timeline. 

6. **Continually Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy, especially if your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Each individual's situation is unique, so consider these factors carefully to develop a strategy that aligns with your personal financial goals.
