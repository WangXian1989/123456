The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match:** First, if your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After getting the match, consider how much you want to contribute to your 401(k). If your employer's plan has good investment options and low fees, this is generally a solid choice for tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. An IRA might offer more investment choices compared to a 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though youâ€™ll have to pay taxes on any capital gains or dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's right for you.
