I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about potential treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Reducing alcohol intake or eliminating it entirely.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce inflammation in the liver.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and health.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver condition.

4. **In severe cases:**
   - Liver transplant may be considered if the liver is significantly damaged.

It's critical to follow up with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
