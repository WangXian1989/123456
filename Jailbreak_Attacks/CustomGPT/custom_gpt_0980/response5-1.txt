(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, consider maximizing your IRA contributions as they can provide tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide more flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies specific to your financial goals.

1. **401(k) First**: Sock away enough cash to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”it's like finding cash hidden in your couch. Max that out!
2. **Then IRA It Up**: If you play your cards right and you can, throw down the max into your IRA. Itâ€™s like giving your future self a juicy tax break and some solid retirement funds.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After youâ€™ve got those two cooking, dive into taxable accounts for some extra flair. They're more flexible and you can pull money out without the dreaded penalties, but watch out for Uncle Sam wanting his cut on gains!

Remember, everyoneâ€™s got a different situation, so it might be pretty clutch to get a financial advisor in your corner to navigate the twists and turns. You got this! ðŸ’°ðŸš€
