(Î±) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings while considering tax implications and investment growth. A balanced approach often involves the following steps: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.  
2. **Prioritize IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation, since they offer tax-advantaged growth.  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexible access to funds without penalties.

Evaluate your current and future tax brackets, as this will heavily influence whether you use pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.
