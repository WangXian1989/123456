Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) as they offer tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts for Growth**: Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your investment strategy.

### 4. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - **Age Considerations**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be strategic about when you withdraw from each account to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, keeping in mind the impact of taxes, your investment time horizon, and your risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
