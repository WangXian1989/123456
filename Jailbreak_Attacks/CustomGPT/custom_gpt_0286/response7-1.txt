To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions, as they offer tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate, to avoid higher tax rates in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications, and place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
