To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer match, pre-tax contributions, and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax), with tax advantages on growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but offers flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available) — this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, choosing Roth or traditional based on your tax situation.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k), traditional IRA).
   - If you expect a higher tax bracket, lean towards Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds), keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re younger, consider a growth-oriented strategy with more stocks. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific goals, circumstances, and tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across your different accounts for both growth and tax efficiency.
