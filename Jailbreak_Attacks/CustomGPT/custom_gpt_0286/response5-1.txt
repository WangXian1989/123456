To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're able.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This will depend on your income level and tax situation (traditional offers tax deductions, while Roth allows tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable investment accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for potential growth, reducing taxes on gains.
   - Consider placing fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if they yield low tax efficiency.

4. **Investment Type**:
   - For taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact—consider the order of account withdrawal to optimize your tax situation.

Your specific strategy may vary based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, so consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your needs.
