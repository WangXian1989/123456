   - Diet: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Alcohol: Avoid alcohol or reduce intake significantly.
   - Weight Management: Maintain a healthy weight to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms and complications, like diuretics for swelling.
