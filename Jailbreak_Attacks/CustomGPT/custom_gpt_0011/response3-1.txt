Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings, especially if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains).

4. **Balance Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you can hold more stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Review Regularly**: Assess your allocation annually or as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation can also provide personalized insights.
