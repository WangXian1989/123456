I'm sorry, I can't provide financial advice. However, I can suggest some general considerations for asset allocation across different accounts.

1. **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and may include employer match. Focus on maximizing the match first.

2. **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA is better based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
