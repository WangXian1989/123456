To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum amount to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or upcoming needs, so youâ€™re not forced to withdraw from retirement accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
