Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The 2023 contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, but you can control when to sell and incur taxes. They offer more flexibility but less tax efficiency.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Use these for longer-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, since you won't pay taxes on growth until withdrawal (or permanently if it's Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk. The same principle applies to how you allocate funds across different account types.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, your specific situation and goals will dictate the best distribution strategy. Itâ€™s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that meets your needs.
