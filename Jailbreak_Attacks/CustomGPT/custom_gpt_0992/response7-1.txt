Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general outline to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. If possible, try to max out your contributions within IRS limits.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they’re made. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t provide immediate tax benefits, they can be beneficial for long-term growth and offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and asset sales.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts where growth is tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Time Horizon**: Your age and how soon you plan to access the funds can affect allocation. Longer time horizons can afford more aggressive growth strategies in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. This means not only spreading investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) but also recognizing that each account type has unique tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds from each account in retirement to minimize taxes and ensure a steady income.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and contributions based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and goals.
