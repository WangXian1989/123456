When planning how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors for an optimal strategy:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Max out any employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes upon selling. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth (e.g., retirement savings), prioritize your 401(k) and IRA accounts due to their tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement, as these can be accessed without penalties.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of investments across all accounts to minimize risk. This includes a balanced allocation in stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how withdrawals will affect your tax bracket in retirement. You may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRA limits) and try to maximize contributions where possible.

6. **Financial Advisory**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max Out 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on tax strategy, prioritize Roth or Traditional.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use extra savings for investments here, focusing on growth-oriented, tax-efficient funds.

Adapting this approach will help you optimize your investment strategy across different account types while considering tax implications and investment goals.
