Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and individual circumstances. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met), while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions for contributions, depending on your income.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) might be advantageous for tax-free growth. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, Traditional accounts (like a Traditional IRA or 401(k)) might make more sense.

4. **Invest Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for investments. Keep in mind that capital gains may be taxed, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified to manage risk effectively. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so itâ€™s important to review your asset allocation and contributions regularly. Adjust as needed based on life changes (such as marriage, children, or career changes).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.

Each individual's situation is unique, so it's essential to take into account your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for retirement.
