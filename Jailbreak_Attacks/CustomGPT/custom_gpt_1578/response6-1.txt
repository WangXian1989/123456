The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach this decision:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Matching:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Strategy:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your tax burden now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits to maximize benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Taxable accounts provide flexibility without penalties for withdrawals before retirement age.
   - **Taxable Events:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments long-term to minimize these impacts.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
- **Balance Growth and Risk:** Allocate a higher percentage to accounts with tax advantages while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your asset distribution reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### **Final Note:**
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your allocations and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals.
- **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation. 

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded strategy to distribute your money effectively across your accounts.
