Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before investing heavily, pay off any high-interest debts (like credit cards), as the interest on these can outweigh investment gains.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match first, then consider maxing out contributions if you're eligible. The contribution limit for a 401(k) can be higher than other retirement accounts.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: After maximizing the employer match, consider funding an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawing funds but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors might prioritize stocks (higher growth potential) in their retirement accounts, while older investors might lean toward bonds (more stable).

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation matches your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Don’t forget to maintain an emergency fund with sufficient liquid assets (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) to cover unexpected events.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider reaching out to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

It's essential to adjust this strategy as your circumstances change and to stay informed about changes in tax laws and investment opportunities.
