It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. 

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs may offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for funding short-term goals or covering emergency expenses.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, ensure your investments are properly diversified based on your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts can be more aggressively invested since they are long-term, whereas taxable accounts may benefit from more conservative investments to minimize tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each type of account. For example, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.
