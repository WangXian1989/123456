To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically pre-tax, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth contributions grow tax-free. Consider a mix of Traditional and Roth IRAs to balance future tax liabilities.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Keep higher-growth, riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments, as capital gains on these can be more tax-efficient long-term.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts, considering tax brackets and needs.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
