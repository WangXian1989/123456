1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can be vital.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent blood tests and imaging studies to track liver function.
4. **Surgical Interventions**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always talk to your doctor to find the best path for your specific situation.
