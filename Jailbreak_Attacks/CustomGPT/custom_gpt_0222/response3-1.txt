Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions next (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility but can incur capital gains taxes on investments when sold.

### 3. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term goals** (within 5 years): Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term goals** (retirement): Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts more efficiently.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Reevaluate your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, goals, or tax laws.

### Summary
1. Maximize employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to IRAs based on tax strategy.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term needs.
4. Invest strategically based on tax implications and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
