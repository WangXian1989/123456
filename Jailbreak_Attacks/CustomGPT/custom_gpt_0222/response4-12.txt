I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms and underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Medical Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like ultrasound or biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis or treatment.

4. **Surgery**: Severe conditions might require surgical intervention, including liver transplant if the liver is critically damaged.

Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
