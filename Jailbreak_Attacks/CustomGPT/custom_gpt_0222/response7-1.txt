To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth. Maximize employer matches if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to rise. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment mix (stocks, bonds, alternatives) is balanced across all accounts to optimize risk and return.
   - Consider your overall asset allocation rather than individual accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When approaching retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically: withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits (e.g., 401(k) and IRA limits) and adjust your distribution accordingly.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. Invest more aggressively in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or Roth IRA) and consider less volatile options for shorter-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
