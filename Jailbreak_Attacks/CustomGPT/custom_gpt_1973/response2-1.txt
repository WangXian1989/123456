The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Health of Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional 401(k) reduces taxable income now but is taxed upon withdrawal. Consider contributing enough to maximize the match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth). If eligible, consider maxing out contributions, focusing on Roth for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments beyond tax-advantaged accounts. Favor investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains) like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you also have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
