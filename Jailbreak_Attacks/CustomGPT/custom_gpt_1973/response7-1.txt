To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option, consider whether it aligns with your tax strategy.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **Tax Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): You'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. These are ideal for investments expected to grow significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals or investments that generate taxable income, like dividends or capital gains. Youâ€™ll want to use these for investments with lower growth expectations or those you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep your asset allocation consistent across accounts but adjust based on account type. For example, higher-risk assets might be more suitable in your 401(k) and IRA where they can grow tax-deferred, while you might want to hold more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocations and make adjustments as necessary to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're close to retirement, prioritize safer investments and consider the liquidity needs of your taxable accounts.

By following these guidelines, you'll optimize your investment growth while managing tax consequences effectively. It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
