To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers taxable income now but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k); consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest here for flexibility. Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Distribute your funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust:** Assess your financial situation regularly and adjust contributions according to changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
