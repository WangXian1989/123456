Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if youâ€™re in a high-income bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Balance your contributions based on your tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or long-term capital gains. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, put higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Impact**: Consider the tax implications of each account type when trading or selling investments.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before maximizing contributions to these accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund.

8. **Long-Term Considerations**: Continuously reassess your allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
