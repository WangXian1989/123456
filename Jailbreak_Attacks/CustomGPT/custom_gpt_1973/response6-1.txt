Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):**
  - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  - Aim to contribute the maximum limit if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
  - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. 
  - If you're looking for current tax deductions, consider a Traditional IRA.

### 2. Use Taxable Accounts Wisely
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
  - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains and improve overall returns.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:**
  - Younger individuals may favor growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift money into more stable, income-producing investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

- **Risk Tolerance:**
  - Assess your risk tolerance and allocate accordingly, ensuring that your investment choices align with your comfort level and financial objectives.

Balancing contributions among these accounts strategically can enhance your overall investment returns while optimizing your tax situation.
