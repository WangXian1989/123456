To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA if you prefer tax deductions.

2. **Prioritize Higher Growth Investments**:
   - Place higher-risk, higher-return investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where potential gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower potential tax burdens, such as bonds or index funds, which may provide capital gains over income.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**:
   - Keep in mind future tax implications when considering withdrawals from these accounts, especially if you're close to retirement.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to align with your financial goals and market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can tailor strategies based on your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
