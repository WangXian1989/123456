To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to secure the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (both traditional and Roth, if eligible). As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Investment Choices**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of mutual funds or other managed products. Focus on low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: You will have a wider variety of investment choices, including individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. Use this to diversify your investments effectively.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or high-yield dividend stocks. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Invest in tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts (like index funds) and place higher-tax-bracket assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts last (Roth IRAs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals by periodically rebalancing your accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Adviser**: For personalized advice, especially considering your unique financial situation and goals, consult with a financial adviser.

It's essential to periodically review your strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and tax laws. Would you like more specific information based on your age or financial goals?
