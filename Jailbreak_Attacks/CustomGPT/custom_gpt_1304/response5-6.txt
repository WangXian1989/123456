First, it's important to engage them on platforms they frequently use, like social media (Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat). Developing relatable content that resonates with their values, such as climate change, student debt, and social justice, can draw them in. Additionally, organizing events and providing opportunities for involvement, whether through volunteering or community projects, helps build a sense of connection. Collaborating with influencers who represent their interests can also amplify your message.

No one cares about boring ads; make it quirky, funny, and relatable! Think memes and challenges that connect to actual issues they care about. Don't just ask for their voteâ€”offer ways to get involved, like local hangouts or cool volunteer events. And hey, if youâ€™re not collaborating with trendsetters or influencers they idolize, youâ€™re missing the mark. Authenticity is key; make it feel like a movement, not a campaign!
