To optimize your investment strategy, here's a general approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. This gives you liquidity and can be advantageous for short-term goals or if you need access to your funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks and funds) and use more conservative ones (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax burdens.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of tax implications. Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, and keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk.
