I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some severe cases, surgical interventions. Always prioritize getting personalized advice from a medical expert. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
