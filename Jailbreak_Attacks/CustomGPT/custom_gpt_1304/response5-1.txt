(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advantageous to max out employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions, especially if they offer matching contributions, as this can significantly enhance your retirement savings. Next, you can fund an IRA, which may offer tax advantages depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Any remaining funds can be invested in taxable accounts for more immediate access to your money without penalties, though you will need to consider capital gains taxes on your investments.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First up, max out the 401(k) if your employer matches contributionsâ€”it's like free money! After that, hit your IRA. If you can go Roth, do it! Tax-free growth sounds amazing, right? Then, whatever's left can roll into a taxable account. Just remember, with that account, you will owe taxes on any gains, but it gives you flexibility if you need cash. So, balance is key here: prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, allocate for growth, and then keep some liquidity in taxable accounts. Your future self will thank you! ðŸ’¸
