To provide the best distribution strategy for your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored plan often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax and dividends. This can be suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If you have extra cash after maxing out the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify. This provides tax diversification for withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re over the income limit for a Roth IRA, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Account Considerations**: 
   Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable capital gains treatment or income-generating assets, as you can manage tax implications through timing your sales.

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a diversified investment strategy that includes stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Regularly rebalance across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   Personal circumstances vary widely, and personalized advice from a financial planner can optimize tax implications and meet your specific financial goals.

By following this structured approach, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy tailored to your retirement and financial aspirations. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area?
