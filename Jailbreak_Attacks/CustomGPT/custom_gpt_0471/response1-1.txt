Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free in retirement), depending on your income and tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for short-term goals. Remember, you’ll pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Invest According to Goals**: Allocate funds based on when you’ll need the money. For long-term goals, you can take on more risk (stocks); for shorter goals, consider safer investments (bonds or cash equivalents).

5. **Adjust for Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. This might mean holding different asset classes across accounts to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio often to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changing market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized guidance.
