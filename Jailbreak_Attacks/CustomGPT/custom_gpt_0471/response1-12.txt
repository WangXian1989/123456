I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common approaches for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving your diet, losing weight if you're overweight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Supplements**: Some may find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but consult your doctor before taking any.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplants may be necessary.

Make sure to get a professional evaluation for your specific situation!
