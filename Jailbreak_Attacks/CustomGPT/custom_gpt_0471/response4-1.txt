To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. You may also want to contribute to the maximum limit, which is $20,500 for 2022 (or $27,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2022, the limit is $6,000 (or $7,000 if over 50). Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals.
   - For those with higher current incomes, tax-deferred accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be beneficial.

3. **Evaluate Your Investment Options**: 
   - Investment choices can vary between accounts. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, while taking advantage of the investment options in each account.

4. **Assess Your Liquidity Needs**:
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. If you think you'll need access to funds before retirement age, ensure you allocate enough to these accounts.

5. **Rebalancing and Contributions**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations within each account based on performance and your changing financial goals.
   - Consider making regular contributions (monthly or quarterly) to each account rather than a lump sum to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If unsure, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances and goals.

By considering these factors, you can allocate your investments in a way that maximizes growth while taking advantage of tax benefits.
