I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can vary greatly in type and severity. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit intake of processed foods.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation.

Always seek medical advice for personalized treatment.
