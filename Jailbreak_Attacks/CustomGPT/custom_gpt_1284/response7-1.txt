When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the unique benefits and tax implications of each type of account. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free retirement withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you havenâ€™t maxed out your 401(k) contributions, consider directing more funds here, as it typically has higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After optimizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer liquidity and flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, retirement accounts may hold more aggressive investments (like stocks), while you might consider safer investments in taxable accounts to balance your overall risk.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Spread out the types of investments in your accounts wisely. For instance, hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in retirement accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
