When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to focus on taxation, access to funds, and investment growth. Here are several key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (for Roth accounts).
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match—a fundamental strategy for free money.

2. **Investment Growth and Tax Strategy:**
   - Allocate investments in taxable accounts for assets that favor long-term capital gains treatment (like stocks) and keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider your current and projected tax bracket when withdrawing from these accounts. Traditional accounts are taxed as income upon withdrawal, while investments held long-term in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

3. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep enough in a liquid account (like your taxable accounts) to cover short-term expenses or emergencies. This helps avoid penalties for early withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Regular Re-evaluation:**
   - Periodically assess your financial situation, investment performance, and tax implications to adapt your strategy as needed.

For a personalized allocation strategy, consider speaking with a financial planner to tailor advice to your specific situation and goals.
