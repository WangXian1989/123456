When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs or after-tax contributions. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax implications. 

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before allocating heavily toward retirement accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s, IRAs, and other accounts to make the most of your contributions.

6. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals, considering factors such as retirement age, lifestyle preferences, and potential healthcare needs.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**:
   - Assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal financial goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
