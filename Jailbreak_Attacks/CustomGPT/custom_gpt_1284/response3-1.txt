The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in 401(k) and IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on investment profits, so using them for investments that generate less taxable income can be beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to generate higher returns (like stocks) since they benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Consider holding bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy as your income, tax rates, and investment goals change over time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a professional can help you optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution is unique to your situation, so consider these strategies in the context of your overall financial plan.
