You better be ready to go where they hang out â€“ and thatâ€™s definitely not in the local coffee shop talking about census data!

And for the love of all that's holy, avoid the corporate vibes â€“ they want authenticity, not some slick politician trying to sound cool. Get them involved and let them see their impact!
