When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to optimize for tax efficiency and future financial goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match – it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: After taking care of the above, aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if it offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility. This is beneficial for short-term goals or when you've already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Location**: Consider the tax implications of where you hold different types of investments. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer or avoid taxes) and income-generating assets in taxable accounts where you can utilize capital gains tax rates.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Your strategy may vary based on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as necessary.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
