The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (essentially free money).
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions but tax is owed on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, as there are no restrictions on withdrawals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxable events.

**Strategy**:
- Start by maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
- Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for specific goals, keeping in mind tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

**Considerations**:
- Assess your current tax situation and expected future tax rates.
- Balance between long-term growth and liquidity needs.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
