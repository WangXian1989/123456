I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition. General approaches may include:

1. **Medications**: To manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can help with fatty liver disease.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be needed.
