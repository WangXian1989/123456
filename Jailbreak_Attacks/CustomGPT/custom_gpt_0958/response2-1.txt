Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that off first before maximizing retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider taxable accounts for any additional savings. This might be beneficial for financial goals that occur before retirement (e.g., purchasing a house).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Generally, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may belong in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like stocks) can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy regularly, especially as your income, tax bracket, and financial goals change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
