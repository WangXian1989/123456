To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRAs**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out any company match, consider increasing your contributions here, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after you've maxed your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies outside of these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.
