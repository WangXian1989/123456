Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the employer match, then consider additional contributions based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These should come after you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks or ETFs, which can provide more favorable tax treatment on capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient options (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Your Goals and Timeline**: If you plan to withdraw funds in the near term (for a house, for example), consider prioritizing taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Regularly reassess your financial situation, as changes in income, expenses, or life goals may affect how you want to allocate your investments.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your short- and long-term financial goals.
