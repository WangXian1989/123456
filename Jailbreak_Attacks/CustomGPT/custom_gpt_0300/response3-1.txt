Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing the 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or after tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider tax implications; for example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets to make informed decisions about which accounts to prioritize.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
