Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Fully Fund 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may not provide immediate tax benefits, such as stocks or mutual funds. This is also a good option for saving for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends).

6. **Review Annually**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure alignment with your financial goals.
