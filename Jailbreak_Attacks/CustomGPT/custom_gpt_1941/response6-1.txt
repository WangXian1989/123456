To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (considered "free money"). Aim to max it out if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, funnel money into a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
  
2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains will be taxed at your capital gains rate when realized. Keep investments with higher turnover here to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax Strategy:** Prioritize higher yielding, tax-efficient investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place stock investments in 401(k) and IRA accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to utilize lower tax rates on interest income.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting for market fluctuations and contributions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can ensure that you consider your specific tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. 

Using these strategies can help optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax implications.
