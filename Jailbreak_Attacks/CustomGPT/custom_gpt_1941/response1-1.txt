The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs can give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level and tax situation, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider adding money to taxable accounts. These are more flexible regarding withdrawals, which can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies. Additionally, investments in these accounts can take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Within each account, use a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This typically involves a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of tax implications when choosing investments for each account. For instance, you may want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocations across accounts to ensure you remain aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, goals, and tax situation.

Ultimately, the allocation across these accounts should align with your overall financial plan and goals.
