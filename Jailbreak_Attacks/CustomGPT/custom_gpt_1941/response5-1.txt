(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, a good approach would be to:

1. Maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."
2. Contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth), especially if you qualify for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.
3. Allocate any additional savings to your 401(k) or taxable accounts depending on your short-term and long-term needs, using taxable accounts for more immediate access to funds or less tax-advantaged investments.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to suit your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut through the sugarcoating! The best way to divvy up your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to get your priorities straight and play the long game. First off, max out that 401(k) to snag any employer matchesâ€”think of it as free cash slapping you in the face. Then, dive into the IRA pool; if you're doing a Roth, keep in mind those tax-free fireworks when you retire. 

Once youâ€™ve taken care of those two, sprinkle any excess cash into your taxable accounts. But remember, donâ€™t toss it all in one basket! Diversify, baby! You want flexibility for when you need to withdraw without the tax repercussions biting your behind. Just make sure you're not stuffing all your cash in taxable accountsâ€”which might cost you in taxes later on. Itâ€™s all about that balance, my friend! Now go forth and invest wisely!
