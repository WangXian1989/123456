I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're dealing with (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common strategies may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing intake of fats and sugars.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through exercise.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Treatments:** 
   - Some may look into herbal supplements, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional before trying these.

It's crucial to consult your physician or a liver specialist for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
