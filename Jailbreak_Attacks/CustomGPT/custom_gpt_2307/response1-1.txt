Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions up front.
   - **401(k)**: After getting the match, consider maximizing your contributions. Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate frequent income (like bonds) or for goals within the next few years. Consider tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified. This helps manage risk while aiming for returns.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Assess your short-term liquidity needs. Keep some cash or liquid assets in your taxable accounts if you anticipate needing funds soon.

6. **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate a more aggressive investment strategy within your tax-advantaged accounts since they’re intended for long-term growth, and you'll benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

7. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
