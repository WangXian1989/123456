Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debts, consider paying those off before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

3. **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth. Choose low-fee investment options within your plan.

4. **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if it's beneficial for your tax situation.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your contributions and asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
