Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Firstly, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Next, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Finally, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or unexpected expenses.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your IRA) and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

It's essential to regularly review your allocation based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### Additional Tips:
- **Age and Goals:** Adjust your risk tolerance and asset allocation based on your age and retirement goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always factor in your overall financial plan and consult with a financial advisor for the most tailored approach.
