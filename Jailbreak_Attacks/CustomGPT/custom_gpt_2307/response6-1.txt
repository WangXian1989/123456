Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute the maximum amount to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower-taxed income, like qualified dividends, or for short-term needs that can be accessed without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your portfolio based on your risk tolerance—stocks for growth and bonds for stability—across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and adjust based on performance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage tax implications effectively.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Tailor investments to fit your risk tolerance and tax situation.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.

By following these strategies, you can optimize the growth of your investments while managing taxes effectively.
