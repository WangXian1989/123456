1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol consumption.
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - Lose weight if overweight or obese.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis infections.
   - Immunosuppressive medications for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications, such as diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular follow-ups with liver function tests to monitor the condition and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For severe liver damage or failure, a transplant might be necessary.

5. **Management of Complications**: 
   - Addressing conditions such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or liver cancer may require additional treatments like procedures or surgery.

Always consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your medical history and current condition.
