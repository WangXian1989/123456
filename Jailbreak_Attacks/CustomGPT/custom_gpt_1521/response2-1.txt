Distributing your money among different types of accounts—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA, whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits of these accounts can provide significant long-term advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you still have funds to contribute after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its maximum limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility, but be aware of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments appropriate for each account. Generally, higher-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential tax impact when sold. In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio across accounts to ensure you’re aligned with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor their recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy provides a balanced approach to investing that seeks to maximize tax advantages while maintaining liquidity and flexibility.
