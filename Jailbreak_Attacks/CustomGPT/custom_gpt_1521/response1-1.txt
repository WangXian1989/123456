Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider putting money into a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maximizing your match and IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility and liquidity, though you will be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might have a more aggressive portfolio, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative investments.

6. **Regular Reevaluation**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and the distribution of your investments as your financial situation and goals evolve.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, seeking advice from a financial professional can help tailor the distribution to your specific needs.

Each person’s financial situation is unique, so consider your specific circumstances when determining the best distribution for you.
