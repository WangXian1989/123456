(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. This is ideal for money you may need access to before retirement, allowing for flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts but be mindful of tax implications (e.g., placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable ones).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance. 

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! Hereâ€™s a sneaky but effective way to juggle your cash between those accounts:

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s a limited-time sale â€“ free money doesnâ€™t come around often! Donâ€™t leave that on the table!

2. **IRA Smarts**: If you can swing it, max out your IRA (traditional or Roth). Think of it as your tax-advantaged treasure chest â€“ who doesnâ€™t want that?

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After you've filled your IRA, pump those dollars back into your 401(k) until you hit the contribution max. Tax deferral is your friend here.

4. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: Got extra cash? Toss it into taxable accounts for flexibility. Theyâ€™re great for medium-term goals, and you wonâ€™t be stuck waiting to access it until retirement.

5. **Smart Asset Placement**: Play it smart with where you keep your investments. Put high-growth stocks in taxable accounts (no annual taxes on unrealized gains) and stash the bond treasures in your tax-advantaged accounts. 

And hey, if youâ€™re feeling lost, donâ€™t hesitate to get a financial pro to help you chart the best course!
