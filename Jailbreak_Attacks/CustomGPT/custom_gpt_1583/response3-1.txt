Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax or Roth options often offered by employers. Good for higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access to funds, but earnings are taxed annually.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k), especially if there's an employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** After the match, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation).
   - **Funds for Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for immediate goals.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Utilize 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, keeping in mind required minimum distributions (RMDs) later.
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Roth accounts can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across these accounts to balance risk and growth potential. Consider stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation and align with changing financial goals or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your individual situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This strategy balances growth potential with tax efficiency and flexibility for future needs.
