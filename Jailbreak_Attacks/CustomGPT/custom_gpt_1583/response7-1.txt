Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### Overview of Account Types:
1. **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth. Suitable for long-term retirement savings.
2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Also offers tax advantages. Choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or Traditional for current tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize Roth IRA contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s if you need the tax deduction now.

3. **Diversify Between Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds across all three accounts to balance tax advantages and access depending on your strategy.
   - A common distribution might be 50% in a 401(k), 30% in an IRA, and 20% in taxable accounts. Adjust based on your specific circumstances.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.

5. **Consider Risk Tolerance**:
   - Invest according to your risk tolerance across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor for personalized planning. Adjust contributions based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions.
