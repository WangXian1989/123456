I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, consulting a healthcare professional is crucial. Common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help manage liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Please see a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
