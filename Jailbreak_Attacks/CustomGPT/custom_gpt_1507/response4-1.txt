To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, with a catch-up option for those 50+).
   - **IRA**: The limit is typically $6,500 for 2023 (with a $1,000 catch-up for age 50+).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but focus on tax efficiency.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation across asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your distribution and adjust based on performance, market conditions, and changes in personal circumstances.

7. **Future Needs**: Consider your expected withdrawals in retirement and how that might impact which accounts to prioritize now.

By balancing immediate tax benefits, employer matches, and long-term growth potential, you can create a sound investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
