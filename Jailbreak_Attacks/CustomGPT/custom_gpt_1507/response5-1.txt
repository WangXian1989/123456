Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider maxing contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA next. The Roth is preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
- **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax treatment.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It’s suitable for shorter-term goals or if you need liquidity.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments (like stocks) since they can compound tax-free.
- Hold bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impact.

### 4. Review and Adjust
- Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on your financial situation and market conditions.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personalized advice from a professional can help align your distribution strategy with your individual goals and situation.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning your contributions with your goals, you can optimize your investment strategy.
