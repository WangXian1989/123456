Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) First:**
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - After the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. The choice between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Taxable Account Contributions**
   - **Supplement with Taxable Accounts:**
     - Once you've maxed your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This offers greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but may incur taxation on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Bunch Income:**
     - If you expect your income to fluctuate, consider bunching your contributions in lower-income years to utilize tax benefits.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Investment Types:**
     - Diversify your investments across accounts (stocks, bonds, real estate). Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can go into taxable accounts.

### 6. **Reassess Annually**
   - **Review Strategy:**
     - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Summary
- **Step 1:** Contribute to your 401(k) to get the match.
- **Step 2:** Max out your IRA contributions.
- **Step 3:** Use surplus funds for taxable accounts.
- **Step 4:** Diversify investments across these accounts.
- **Step 5:** Reassess your strategy annually.
