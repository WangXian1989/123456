Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Goal:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Action:** Aim for at least 5-6% or the maximum your employer matches.

### 2. **Fund Your IRA**
   - **Goal:** If eligible, prioritize funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for its tax advantages.
   - **Action:** Contribute up to the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Contribute More to 401(k)**
   - **Goal:** After maxing out your IRA, redirect funds to your 401(k).
   - **Action:** Maximize contributions, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Goal:** Use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term goals.
   - **Action:** After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing additional savings here.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
This strategy balances the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity and flexibility with taxable investments. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
