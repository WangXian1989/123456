(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility, especially if you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts.

Keep in mind the contribution limits and tax implications of each account type. It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution that aligns with your specific financial circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like making a killer playlistâ€”each track (or account) has its groove! Hereâ€™s how to jam:

1. **401(k) Party Time**: Go for the employer match first! It's like getting a bonus track on your mixtape. Don't miss out on that free cash, baby!
   
2. **IRA Shenanigans**: Next up, hit that IRA! If youâ€™re into tax deductions and want to save for retirement without all the tax drama, go traditional. But if you want to rock out tax-free withdrawals in retirement, Roth is your buddy!

3. **Taxable Account Beats**: Finally, the taxable account is your after-party spotâ€”flexible and perfect for pulling cash whenever you need it. Just be careful with those capital gains; nobody likes an unexpected tax hangover!

Mix it up, stay aware of contribution limits, but remember: itâ€™s your money! So make it work for you! And donâ€™t forget to check in with a financial advisor for personalized advice!
