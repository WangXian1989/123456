Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, taxes will apply upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals, but investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for funds you'll need before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. This could mean a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Strategic Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Annual Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your situation changes (such as income level or life events) and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
