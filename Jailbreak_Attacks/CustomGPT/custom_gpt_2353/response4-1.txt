Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a concise guide to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Choose between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your current tax rate and expected future tax rate upon withdrawal.

2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and try to contribute the maximum if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings you might need before retirement since they allow for easier access to funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate less taxable income.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your overall asset allocation across all accounts, maintaining a balance that fits your risk tolerance.
   - Generally, it's wise to hold higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out employer match in 401(k).
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA based on tax strategy.
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on liquidity and tax efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation.
