Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and a great return on investment.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this off before making substantial contributions to investment accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider putting extra funds in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for short-term goals and can help manage tax implications.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to benefit from employer matches, use tax-advantaged accounts effectively, and maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for flexibility.
