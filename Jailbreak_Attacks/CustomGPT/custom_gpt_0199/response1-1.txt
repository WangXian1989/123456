Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of the match. Consider using it for higher risk investments due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments. These are more flexible and can be used for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on gains.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.
