When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as these provide tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility in withdrawing funds in retirement while managing your tax bracket.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Use your taxable accounts for investments with high turnover or those that are better suited for long-term holding, like certain stocks or ETFs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
