Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Roth options are tax-free in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits; Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Accessibility**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus retirement accounts on long-term, potentially higher-growth investments.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid needs, keeping an eye on capital gains.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts for risk management.

### 5. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, consider a strategy for withdrawing from accounts in a tax-efficient manner, potentially using taxable accounts first.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
