To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds available after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

This balanced approach allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and flexibility.
