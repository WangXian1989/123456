Determining the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match before directing money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it off before investing, as the interest on debt can outweigh investment returns.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking advantage of the employer match, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if it's a traditional 401(k) which offers tax-deferred growth. 

4. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can begin contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you will need to consider the tax implications of your investment gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation across all accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep in mind that tax-advantaged accounts may be suitable for more aggressive investments due to tax-free growth.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your financial situation and investment contributions regularly to ensure they still align with your goals and adjust as needed.
