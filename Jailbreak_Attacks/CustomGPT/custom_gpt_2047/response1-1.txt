The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax advantages as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with different tax implications.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type. This helps mitigate risk.

4. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, keep a portion of your money in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings (401(k), IRA) and consider taxable accounts for any shorter-term goals or emergencies.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
