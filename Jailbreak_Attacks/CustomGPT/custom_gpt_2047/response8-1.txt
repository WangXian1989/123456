The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider when allocating your investments across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of it first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals, but you'll have to pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax liability. Meanwhile, keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and thresholds.

Remember that investment strategies should be tailored to your specific circumstances and goals, and it's essential to do your own research or consult with a professional.
