Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** 
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k), especially if you benefit from tax deferrals and employer matching.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider placing additional savings in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Understand how withdrawals and capital gains tax may impact your overall returns, and plan accordingly.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages:** As you get closer to retirement, you might shift your focus towards income-generating investments in these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial planner can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts will optimize your growth potential while managing risk and tax implications.
