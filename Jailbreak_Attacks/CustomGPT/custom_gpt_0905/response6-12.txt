To give you the best guidance on liver treatment options, it's important to know the specific liver problem you're facing (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). However, here are common treatment options based on different liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and sugars; consider a Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats.
   - **Weight Management:** Achieving a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health, especially in fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Endoscopy:** For complications like variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver failure or advanced cirrhosis.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and identify complications early.

Consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition and overall health status.
