To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider increasing your contributions to the maximum limit if you can afford to do so.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds here for more immediate goals or if you want access to money before retirement age. In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balanced Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Aim for a balanced portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-yielding assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest from taxes. For stocks with potential growth, index funds, or ETFs, consider keeping them in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals, especially after significant market movements.

By strategically allocating contributions and investments according to these principles, you can optimize your money distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for both tax efficiency and growth.
