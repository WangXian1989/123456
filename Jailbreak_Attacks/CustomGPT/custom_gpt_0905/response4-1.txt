Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time frame. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Depending on your income level, a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA could be beneficial. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now. Consider funding this next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth.

3. **Use the 401(k) for Higher Contributions**: After maximizing your match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of its higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be particularly useful for short- to medium-term savings goals, as funds can be accessed easily without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, holding assets that generate interest in your tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial because they won’t incur taxes until withdrawal.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
