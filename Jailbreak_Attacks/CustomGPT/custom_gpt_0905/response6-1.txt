To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Taxable Bonds**: If holding bonds, use tax-advantaged accounts to shelter interest income from taxes.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Accessibility**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Fit for long-term growth; generally less accessible without penalties until retirement age.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawing funds without penalties, suitable for emergency savings or specific financial goals.

By balancing contributions based on tax advantages and liquidity needs, you can optimize your investment strategy.
