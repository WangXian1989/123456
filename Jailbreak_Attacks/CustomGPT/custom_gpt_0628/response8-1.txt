The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) (or if you don't have one), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Eligibility**:
   - Check the income limits for Roth IRA contributions. If you're above those limits, consider a traditional IRA or backdoor Roth IRA contributions (contributing to a traditional IRA and then converting to a Roth).

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals and investments. They provide liquidity and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Revisit your allocation periodically based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws. Adjust contributions relative to market performance and your personal circumstances.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Strategically plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each type of account in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize your income.
