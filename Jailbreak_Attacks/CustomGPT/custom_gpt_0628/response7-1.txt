To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA as well. Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).

2. **Assess Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - Focus on short-term goals in taxable accounts, where you may need access sooner. For long-term investments, prioritize retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term, higher-growth investments. In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of taxes; taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, while contributions and growth in tax-advantaged accounts are not taxed until withdrawal (or not at all in the case of Roth accounts).

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure compliance with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By structuring your contributions based on these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
