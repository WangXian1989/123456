When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to account for your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

2. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it down before investing aggressively.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can (up to the limit) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or short-term capital gains) but are also more flexible in terms of withdrawals.

6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Consider holding more interest-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to manage taxes more effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations and account types to ensure they align with your goals, tax implications, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
