To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if itâ€™s a traditional IRA. If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year received.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: 
   - If you have high-interest debt (e.g., credit card debt), prioritize paying that off before routing excess cash to investments.

4. **Set up Automatic Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions to each account to ensure consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

5. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account, ensure you have a diverse portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors may lean more towards equities for growth in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or stable value funds to protect against market fluctuations.

7. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and those generating high taxable income (like bonds) in your taxable account to manage tax efficiency.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation, especially after significant market movements or life events (like a new job, marriage, etc.).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
