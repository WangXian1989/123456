(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. You might consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, which can offer significant tax benefits.
3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing contributions to these retirement accounts, you can utilize taxable accounts for investments that may offer more liquidity or for money you may need in the near term.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals.
