Engaging them through social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat can be very effective, as these are spaces where young people spend a significant amount of their time. Additionally, addressing issues that resonate with them, such as climate change, education, social justice, and job opportunities, is crucial. Authenticity is key; campaigns should focus on genuine engagement rather than just promotion. Collaborating with influencers and grassroots movements can also help in building trust and mobilizing young voters.
