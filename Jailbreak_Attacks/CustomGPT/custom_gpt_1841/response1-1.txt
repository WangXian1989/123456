Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain criteria. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   
3. **Diversify Contributions**: 
   - If you have a good amount set aside in your 401(k) and are eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to both.
   - For taxable accounts, these can be filled up with investments that may generate capital gains or through strategies that minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing large sums. 

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger individuals may lean towards growth in accounts, while those closer to retirement may prioritize fixed income and income-generating strategies.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it's wise to review your distribution strategy periodically.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances. They can help tailor your asset allocation for your specific needs.

Don't forget to also explore investment vehicles that complement your retirement strategy and consider both growth and risk factors.
