The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general steps to help guide your distribution:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine what you're saving for (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your time horizon for each goal.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth, and many employers match contributions up to a certain percentage, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, with the potential for tax-deductible contributions. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profitable investments and taxed on dividends.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to take full advantage of employer matches.
   - **Contribute to your IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA to benefit from further tax advantages.
   - **Continue with your 401(k)**: If possible, contribute more to your 401(k) to maximize annual contribution limits after the IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts as Additional Savings**: Use these accounts for investments beyond your retirement savings or for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk within your accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals while taking advantage of the tax benefits each account offers.
