When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Withdrawals and Taxes:**
   - Contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA are made pre-tax, meaning you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Roth contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diverse Investment Allocation:**
   - Ensure that your investment allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. You may want to prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re planning for retirement that’s many years away, consider maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. If you have short-term goals, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

5. **Adjust Based on Financial Situations:**
   - Regularly review your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions to adjust your distribution accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations.

By balancing contributions across these different account types, you can optimize your savings and investment strategy for retirement and beyond. Always consider seeking professional advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
