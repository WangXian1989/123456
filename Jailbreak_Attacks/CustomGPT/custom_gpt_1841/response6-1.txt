To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
  
2. **Investment Growth**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA since these accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for income-generating investments like bonds or dividend stocks, which may benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically based on your tax situation in retirement to minimize the tax impact.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment growth while managing the tax implications effectively. If you have specific financial goals, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
