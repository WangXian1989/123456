Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) if you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. This helps reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you might need before retirement or for investments that have favorable tax treatments, such as index funds or tax-efficient investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific situation.
