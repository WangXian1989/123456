Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, the tax benefits may differ. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This can help mitigate risks.

5. **Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Consider your age and how long you have until retirement. Younger investors might opt for a more aggressive allocation in stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer safer investments.

6. **Revisit and Rebalance**: Your asset allocation should be revisited periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your needs.

Ultimately, the balance will depend on your individual financial circumstances and goals.
