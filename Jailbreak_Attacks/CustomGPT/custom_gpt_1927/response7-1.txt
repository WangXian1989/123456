Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible based on your income level and participation in an employer plan. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. Consider using them for non-retirement goals or if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Invest across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, but remember that your retirement accounts may focus more on long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be weighted more towards income-generating assets that might be taxed differently.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity (3-6 months of expenses) outside of your retirement accounts before heavily funding them. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary a lot, so consulting with a certified financial planner can help tailor the distribution to your specific needs.

In conclusion, it is beneficial to balance your contributions across these accounts while considering factors such as employer match, tax implications, and overall investment strategy.
