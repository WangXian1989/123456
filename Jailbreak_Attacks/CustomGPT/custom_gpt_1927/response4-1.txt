To distribute your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After obtaining the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: When choosing where to allocate your investments, consider the tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), you can deduct contributions from your taxable income, deferring taxes until retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so they may be better suited for investments you plan to hold for a shorter term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax growth, while more stable investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the market can shift the value of your investments, so itâ€™s essential to periodically review and rebalance your allocations to align with your investment strategy and financial goals.

This approach helps maximize your investment growth while considering the tax implications of each account type. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
