(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Accounts**: It's often beneficial to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and taxable accounts. This creates flexibility in retirement by allowing you to manage your tax liabilities better.

4. **Assess Withdrawal Strategies**: Your age and retirement timeline can impact how you should allocate funds. Younger individuals may lean more towards growth investments within tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may prioritize income generation and stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary to ensure that you’re maintaining your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First, Baby**: If your employer is tossing in some free cash with a match, you absolutely need to jump on that train first. It’s like finding money in your couch cushions but better!

2. **Tax Slayers Unite**: Traditional accounts give you that instant tax “wow” factor, lowering your taxable income now. But Roth options are the way to go if you think you’ll be swimming in higher taxes down the road. Why pay more later when you can skate by tax-free in retirement?

3. **Mix It Up!**: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, my friend. Balance it out with a healthy mix of accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts are your long-game players, while taxable ones give you that immediate access – perfect for those emergencies or spontaneous trips!

4. **Withdrawal Strategies for the Win**: Think ahead! Your age should determine your play. If you're young, go aggressive with your growth. Nearing retirement? Time to chill and think income!

5. **Keep On Top**: Seriously, don’t set and forget. Keep your eye on those investments and tweak them as necessary, just like you would adjust the volume on your favorite playlist.
