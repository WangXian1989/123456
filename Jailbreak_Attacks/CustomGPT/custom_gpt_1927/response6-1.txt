To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains are subject to capital gains taxes. However, you can strategically manage tax implications through loss harvesting and long-term investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account. Retirement accounts may allow for more aggressive investments, while taxable accounts can be more liquid for short-term goals.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out accounts like your 401(k) and IRA can provide significant tax advantages.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your Employer’s 401(k)** match first, as it’s essentially "free money."
- **Contribute to an IRA** next, especially if you're eligible for a tax deduction or prefer tax-free growth through a Roth IRA.
- **Fill up any remaining space with a taxable account** for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Additional Considerations:
- **Rebalance regularly** to ensure your risk profile remains aligned with your investment strategy.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized guidance based on your unique situation and financial goals.

This approach can help you efficiently utilize your accounts while considering tax implications and investment strategies.
