To efficiently distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, make this your first priority. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to the above retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is more flexible for withdrawals but comes with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances.
