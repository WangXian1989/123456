Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

3. **Fund Your Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any funds above the 401(k) and IRA limits can be allocated to taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification Considerations**:
   - Keep tax implications in mind: prioritize tax-efficient investments in your taxable account (like index funds) and consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing financial situation and retirement goals.

### Summary:
- **Max 401(k) contributions** for matching.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for tax advantages.
- **Use taxable accounts** for additional liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance when making distributions.
