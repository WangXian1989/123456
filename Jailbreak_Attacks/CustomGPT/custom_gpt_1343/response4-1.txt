Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher Tax Bracket**: Prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k) or Traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income now. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Lower Tax Bracket**: You might consider Roth accounts for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher bracket later.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) within each account type according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep a portion of funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals. This allows easy access without penalties for early withdrawal, as with retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically reassess your investment strategy based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that consider your unique circumstances and goals.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility through taxable accounts, and adjust the distribution based on your financial situation and goals.
