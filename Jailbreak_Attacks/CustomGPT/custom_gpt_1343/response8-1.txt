When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Look at the investment choices offered in your plan. Aim for low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). IRAs can offer tax advantages, either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Tax Diversification:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It may benefit you to keep money in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility; you can withdraw funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or consider strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out the 401(k) match** first, then contribute to an IRA.
2. **If you have additional funds**, consider maxing out the IRA, followed by increasing contributions to your 401(k).
3. **After tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out**, invest in a taxable account for flexibility.

### Portfolio Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.
