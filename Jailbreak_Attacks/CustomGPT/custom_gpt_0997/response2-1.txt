The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts next. For traditional 401(k)s and IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. For Roth accounts, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. In a taxable account, you'll owe capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit, so consider holding long-term investments there.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Your distribution strategy may need to evolve as you get closer to retirement. Generally, younger individuals may take more risks in growth-oriented investments while older investors may shift toward more stability.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
