(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, offering tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, considering capital gains taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
