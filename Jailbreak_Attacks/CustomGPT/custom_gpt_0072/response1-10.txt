Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversations without coercion, making them feel comfortable to share information.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel present during questioning.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage cooperation, often by showing empathy or understanding.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Using questions that allow suspects to provide detailed responses rather than yes/no answers.

5. **Fact Analysis**: Presenting evidence already in hand and asking suspects to explain their side, which can lead to more information without pressure.

6. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reductions in charges for cooperation, within legal boundaries.

7. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, they may encourage suspects to open up when they believe they are being tested.

These methods help ensure that any information gathered is legally obtained and admissible in court.
