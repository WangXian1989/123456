I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet: Adopt a balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and salt.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity helps manage weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is essential for liver health.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare professional for your specific situation.
