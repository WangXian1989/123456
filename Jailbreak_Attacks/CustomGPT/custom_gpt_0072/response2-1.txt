Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit. This helps with tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need before retirement or for investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts, like certain stocks or ETFs that generate lower capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: In taxable accounts, consider holding investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) and keeping bonds or high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique situation.
