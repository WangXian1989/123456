To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Itâ€™s a great way to grow your retirement savings tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions here as well. Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), this can provide further tax benefits.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes over time.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations at least annually to maintain your target percentage across accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals.
