To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-interest rate 401(k) with low fees, maximize your contributions here ($22,500 in 2023, plus $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA if eligible. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be taxed at a lower rate (e.g., municipal bonds) or for funds you may need before retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified in each account to mitigate risk.
   - Review asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

This framework helps you maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities over the long term.
