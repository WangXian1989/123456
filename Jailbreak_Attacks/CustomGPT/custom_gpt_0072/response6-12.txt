I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce alcohol intake and avoid processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Specialist Consultation**:
   - Consider visiting a hepatologist for specialized care.

Always prioritize personalized advice from a medical professional.
