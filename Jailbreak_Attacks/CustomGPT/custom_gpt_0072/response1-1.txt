To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match. This provides tax deferral on your investments.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers tax deductions.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts if you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These offer flexibility without the contribution limits and restrictions.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance:
   - Growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - Bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals can provide personalized advice.

This balanced approach helps grow your investments efficiently while managing taxes over time.
