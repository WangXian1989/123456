I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, typical treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, etc.), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and manage potential complications.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
