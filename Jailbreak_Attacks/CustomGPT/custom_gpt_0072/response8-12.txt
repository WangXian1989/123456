Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, losing weight can significantly help.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Controlling diabetes or high blood pressure can influence liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
