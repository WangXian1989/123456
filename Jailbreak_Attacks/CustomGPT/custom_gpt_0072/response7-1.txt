Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax impact, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but may have capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth; choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k), but you can diversify your investments more widely.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains exposure.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy for your specific situation.
