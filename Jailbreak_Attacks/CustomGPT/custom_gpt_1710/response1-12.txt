I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures, depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation. They might recommend things like a healthy diet, abstaining from alcohol, or medications to manage associated symptoms. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health issues!
