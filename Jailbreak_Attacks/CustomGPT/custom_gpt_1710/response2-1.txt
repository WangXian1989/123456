The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), but there are income limits for tax deductibility. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made post-tax and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Diversify Account Types**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-advantaged accounts (like Roth IRAs). This provides flexibility in withdrawing funds in retirement while managing tax liabilities.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible) before going back to your 401(k) for additional contributions.

5. **Calculate Required Withdrawals**: Depending on your age and stage in life, plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 73, to avoid penalties.

6. **Consider Investment Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments may be more appropriate for accounts intended for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA).

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change. Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
