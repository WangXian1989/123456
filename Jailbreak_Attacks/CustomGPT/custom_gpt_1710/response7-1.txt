When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach to optimize your investment strategy based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this free money. It's a great starting point for your retirement savings.
   
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) as they provide tax benefits. If you’re eligible, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Continue to contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions grow tax-free.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. Utilize long-term capital gains tax rates by holding investments for over a year.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, you'll want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can be tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change. Adjust your contributions to align with your goals.

Engaging a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice for your unique circumstances.
