Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on multiple factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they provide tax benefits either at the time of contribution or during withdrawal.
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, focus on your 401(k), especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, effectively lowering your current tax burden.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: After funding your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Consider your investment strategy**:
   - Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to capitalize on lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

5. **Reassess regularly**: Keep evaluating your allocations based on your changing financial circumstances, tax laws, and retirement goals. Adjust your strategy accordingly.

Itâ€™s important to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your individual situation for personalized guidance.
