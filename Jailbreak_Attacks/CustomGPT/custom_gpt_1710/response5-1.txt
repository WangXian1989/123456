(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before allocating funds to taxable accounts. 

For example, you might consider fully funding your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions, then contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, and allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This approach helps minimize your tax burden and maximizes growth potential over time.

First off, always max out that employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if youâ€™re getting free money from matching contributions! That's like finding a ten-dollar bill in your coat pocket but a lot better. 

Next up, dive into that IRA pool. If youâ€™re feeling a little frisky with taxes, a Roth IRA might be your jam because you pay taxes now and cash out tax-free later. Finally, once youâ€™ve filled those sweet tax-advantaged pots to the brim, dump whatever's left into those taxable accounts. Just remember: balance is key, and maybe do some tax-loss harvesting in those taxable accounts to keep the IRS off your back! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
