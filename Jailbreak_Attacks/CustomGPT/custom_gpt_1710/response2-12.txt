I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. Medications or procedures may also be recommended depending on the severity and type of liver issue. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
