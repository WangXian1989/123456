Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Timeline**: Ensure your allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change. Rebalancing periodically can help maintain your desired risk level.

A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.
