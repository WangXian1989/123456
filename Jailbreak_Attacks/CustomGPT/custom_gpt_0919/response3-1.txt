Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general framework to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: How much do you need to retire comfortably?
   - **Time Horizon**: Consider when you plan to retire or need access to these funds.

### 2. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax deferral on contributions and potential employer matching. Generally higher contribution limits but limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments made with after-tax dollars. You’ll pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains, but they offer greater flexibility.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA. This can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: No tax on withdrawals if certain conditions are met, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify investments across your accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Contribute to 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Max out Roth IRA** if eligible; otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA.
3. Use any remaining funds for **taxable investments**, strategically placing less volatile investments there to minimize tax impact.

### Conclusion
Each individual's situation is unique. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, helping you navigate the complexities of investing and taxation.
