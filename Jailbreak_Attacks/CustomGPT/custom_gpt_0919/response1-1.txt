When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; thatâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Taxation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. They can be suitable for short-term goals or to hold investments with favorable tax treatments, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Distribute your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Different accounts serve different purposes and may benefit from various asset classes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts. This should ideally cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute to get the full match, then consider maxing out if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, prioritizing Roth if you're able.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any extra funds, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.
