Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether to use a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Traditional accounts typically provide tax advantages upfront but tax you on withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexible access but are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments at a profit.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re far from retirement, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for more aggressive growth.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments and consider how you'll withdraw funds.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: 
   - Diversify investments within each account type to manage risk (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Monitor your investment performance and rebalance as necessary based on changing markets or life circumstances.

Overall, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
