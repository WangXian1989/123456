Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. The contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if certain conditions are met.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to retirement accounts, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties, but you'll need to manage taxes on any gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. Generally, you might want to hold assets that generate high income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and ensure that you are not overly exposed to one particular asset class or type of investment.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and align your investments with your long-term financial goals.
