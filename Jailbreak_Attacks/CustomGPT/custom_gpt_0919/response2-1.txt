Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**
   - **Tax Advantage**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Limitations**: Be aware of contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).

### 3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: After maxing out matched contributions and considering IRA contributions, you can focus on taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Focus**: If you're investing for the long-term (more than 5-10 years), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they help reduce your tax burden now.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you need liquidity within the next few years, allocate more funds to taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio within each account, balancing stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Withdrawals and Strategy**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals wisely when you retire, considering tax implications. Often, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Final Thoughts
It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your specific situation and help you develop a tailored strategy. This personalized approach can ensure that your investment distribution aligns with your goals and maximizes tax efficiency.
