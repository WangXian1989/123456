Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**  
   - **Maximize employer match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **Tax advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**  
   - **Tax considerations:** Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution limits:** Prioritize contributing up to the limit if your tax situation allows.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - **Flexibility:** Use these for mid-term goals or emergency savings since they don’t have penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Tax efficiency:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds for capital gains and qualified dividends.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an accessible account before investing heavily.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across all accounts considering your risk tolerance, with a balanced mix of equities and fixed income.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
