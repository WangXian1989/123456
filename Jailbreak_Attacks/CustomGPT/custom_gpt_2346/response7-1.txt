To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income level.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to benefit from its tax advantages.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Place bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, keeping your risk tolerance and investment goals in mind.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and performance, adjusting contributions as financial goals change or as you approach retirement.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**: Look at the fees associated with each account type and the investment options available, which can impact your overall growth.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
