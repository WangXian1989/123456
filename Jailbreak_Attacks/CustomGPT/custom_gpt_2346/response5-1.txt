(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions here as well, keeping in mind the tax implications of each type. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out the first two options. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.

1. **401(k)**: Dive in and fill your plate with any employer match â€” thatâ€™s free money! Go to town until you hit the annual limit if you can swing it.
2. **IRA**: Next up, load your plate with IRA goodness. If youâ€™re eyeing a Roth, youâ€™re scoring the awesome tax-free withdrawals ladder (do it while youâ€™re young!).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve feasted on those, save room for taxable accounts for ice cream later. These are great for short-term fun or side hustles. Diversify like itâ€™s your job, and donâ€™t forget to think about taxes as you nibble.
