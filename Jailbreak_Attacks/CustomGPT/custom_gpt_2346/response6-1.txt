Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now; withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs lower your taxable income; Roth IRAs grow tax-free if qualified conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts, but tailor each account’s investments based on tax efficiency.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep liquid assets in taxable accounts for easy access in case of emergencies.

5. **Rebalance and Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocations as goals and market conditions change.

This strategy aligns your investments with growth potential while managing tax exposure effectively.
