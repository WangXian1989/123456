To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing it after maximizing the 401(k) match. This account offers potential tax advantages.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k), especially if it offers a range of investment options and potential tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals but may have tax implications, especially on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance and Diversify**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and achieve your investment goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Depending on your current and projected tax bracket, you may want to place income-generating investments in tax-deferred accounts and growth-focused investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to adjust based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
