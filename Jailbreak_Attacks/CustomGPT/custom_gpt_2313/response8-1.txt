Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is beneficial if you expect your taxes to increase in the future, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for goals like buying a house.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets here, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Make contributions regularly to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

Assess your needs regularly to adjust your contributions as your financial situation or goals change.
