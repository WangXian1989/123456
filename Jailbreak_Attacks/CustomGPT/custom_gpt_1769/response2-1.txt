Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and an excellent first step.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your employer’s match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). This can be particularly beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket and wish to reduce your taxable income.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible and allow for more investment choices. Additionally, capital gains on investments held for over a year are typically taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Invest in assets that generate high taxes, such as bonds or REITs, which typically produce ordinary income. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on lower-turnover investments like index funds or stocks that you plan to hold for the long term. This can help minimize capital gains distributions.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Based on Goals**
   - Regularly review your investment distribution based on life changes (job changes, marital status, retirement goals) and adjust your contributions accordingly. 

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically prioritizes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before using taxable accounts. It's also wise to consult with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
