Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines that can help you achieve an effective distribution strategy:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offered by employers, this is a tax-advantaged retirement account. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are owed upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar to a 401(k), but it can be set up independently. You have traditional IRAs (pre-tax) and Roth IRAs (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are non-retirement accounts where investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They provide flexibility and liquidity.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings, especially if you receive an employer match on your 401(k).
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now compared to what you expect in retirement, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in the future.

### 3. **Establish an Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in liquid savings, separate from these investment accounts.

### 4. **Allocate Investments Based on Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), lean more toward equities in your tax-advantaged accounts, which can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house), use your taxable accounts for easier access to cash.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diverse investment mix across all accounts, keeping in mind that certain asset classes might perform better in tax-deferred accounts than in taxable ones.

### 6. **Contributions Strategy:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match first (often referred to as "free money"), then contribute to an IRA.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible ($6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older for 2021 and 2022).
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 7. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly check your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Conclusion:
A balanced and strategic approach to distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you optimize your tax efficiency, grow your investments, and achieve your financial goals. Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
