Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic decision that depends on your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline to help you make that decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** 
   - After taking full advantage of any 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Reevaluate Your 401(k) Contributions:**
   - If you're eligible to contribute beyond the match, consider your 401(k) as a way to invest pre-tax dollars. Check the fees and investment options available in your plan, as these can impact your long-term returns.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable brokerage accounts. These are more flexible regarding withdrawals and investments but may be subject to capital gains taxes. 

5. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. In contrast, you might hold higher-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Evaluate Debt and Emergency Savings:**
   - Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place and are addressing any high-interest debt, as this can provide better returns than investments.

7. **Regularly Review Your Allocation:**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, so regular reassessment of your allocations can help keep your strategy on track.

It’s essential to think about your overall financial picture and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
