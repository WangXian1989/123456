The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that might generate high taxable income (like bonds) and keep growth-focused investments (like stocks) that qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk according to your age and goals.

### Key Strategies:
- **Contribute to 401(k) up to the match** before increasing IRA contributions.
- **Prioritize Roth IRA** if you're in a lower tax bracket; otherwise, consider traditional accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial, given the nuances of your situation.
