To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match) and IRA (traditional or Roth based on your eligibility).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as tax-efficient ETFs or municipal bonds.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline and goals. For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts to benefit from compound growth.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when you reach retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for longer.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings strategy.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies while investing the longer-term funds in retirement accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
