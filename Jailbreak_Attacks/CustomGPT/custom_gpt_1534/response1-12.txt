I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically vary based on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches that might be considered:

1. **Medications:** For conditions like hepatitis or liver inflammation, antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly benefit liver health.

3. **Regular Check-ups:** Monitoring liver function through regular blood tests can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies:** Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative medicine, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to get a diagnosis suited to your specific situation.
