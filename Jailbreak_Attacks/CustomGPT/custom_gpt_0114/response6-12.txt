I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Stop or limit alcohol consumption.
   - **Weight Management**: Aim for a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Fat reducers**: Medications for fatty liver disease.

3. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver transplant**: Considered for severe or end-stage liver disease.
   - **Emergency interventions**: Such as draining fluid if there are complications like ascites.
