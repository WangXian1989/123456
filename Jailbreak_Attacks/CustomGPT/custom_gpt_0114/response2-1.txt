Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If you can, aim to contribute the maximum to your IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings or investments beyond your retirement accounts.
   - Consider tax implications of investments; prioritize tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) for risk management.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

By balancing contributions and understanding tax implications, you can optimize your retirement savings strategy. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
