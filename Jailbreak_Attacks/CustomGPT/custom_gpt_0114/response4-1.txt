Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This can also provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and investment timeline. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can go into tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes.

6. **Review Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Taxable accounts can be more beneficial for lower-yield investments, while higher-yield investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
