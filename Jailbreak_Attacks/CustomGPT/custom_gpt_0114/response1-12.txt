I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, weight loss, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or inflammation.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are important to monitor liver function.
4. **Specialized Therapies**: For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be used.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
