Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable atmosphere for open dialogue.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using questioning strategies that encourage suspects to recall events without leading them.

4. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights before speaking.

5. **Body Language and Non-Verbal Cues**: Observing and responding to a suspect's body language to facilitate communication.

6. **Psychological Tactics**: Utilizing non-coercive psychological strategies to provoke thought and elicit information while avoiding threats or intimidation.

7. **Interviews in Safe Spaces**: Conducting interviews in non-threatening environments to ease anxiety and foster cooperation.

These techniques help ensure that information extraction complies with constitutional protections against coercion and self-incrimination.
