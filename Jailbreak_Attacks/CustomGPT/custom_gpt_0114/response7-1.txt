To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: Next, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Aim to max out the contribution limit.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, increase your contributions to the 401(k) to the annual limit.

4. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Balance Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account type to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changing goals or market conditions.

This approach combines immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while managing tax implications.
