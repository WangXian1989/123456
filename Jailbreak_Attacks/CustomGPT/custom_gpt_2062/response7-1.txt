Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax-advantaged; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No specific tax advantages, subject to capital gains tax on profits. Offers more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Useful for high-income years since contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments go in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Step 1**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - **Step 2**: Maximize the IRA contributions (traditional and/or Roth).
   - **Step 3**: Return to the 401(k) to max it out (if feasible) or contribute to taxable accounts as needed.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review your portfolio regularly and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation
- **Age 20-40**: Heavily favor equities in your 401(k) and IRA; use taxable accounts for low-turnover index funds.
- **Age 40-60**: Shift towards a more balanced portfolio with bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce volatility.
- **Age 60+**: Gradually move to more conservative investments; consider required minimum distributions (RMD) from 401(k) and traditional IRA.

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
- Keep abreast of changes in tax laws and contribution limits.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your investments and tax advantages over time.
