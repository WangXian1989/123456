When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies to optimize growth and tax efficiency:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer offers a match. Contribute enough to earn the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Balance for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need before retirement. Investments here can be more liquid and provide flexibility for short-term goals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place stocks or high-growth ETFs in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider keeping bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
