Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages and can be a great way to diversify tax exposure in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable investment account. This can offer flexibility with withdrawals and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement, balancing between accounts accordingly.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.
