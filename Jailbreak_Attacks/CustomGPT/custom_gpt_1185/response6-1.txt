Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, but penalties for early withdrawal.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, but subject to capital gains tax on returns.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- Max out employer match in your **401(k)** first to take advantage of free money.
- Contribute to an **IRA** (Roth if eligible, for long-term tax benefits).
- Use **taxable accounts** for investments beyond retirement limits or for short-term goals.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- Utilize tax-deferred accounts for high-income years.
- Shift to Roth IRAs or taxable accounts when in a lower tax bracket to maximize tax efficiency.

### 4. Diversification Strategy
- Balance risk by diversifying across all accounts.
- Focus on growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize immediate taxation.

### Summary
- **Maximize 401(k)** employer match.
- **Prioritize IRA contributions** (consider Roth if eligible).
- Utilize **taxable accounts** for flexibility and additional investments.
