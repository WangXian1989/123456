Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax or Roth options available. Consider your future tax rate.
   - **IRA**: Similar choices; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals and flexibility, but gains are taxed annually.

### 3. **Consider Investment Needs**
   - Allocate risk according to your timeline. Longer-term goals can lean towards more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs might be better suited for safer options in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals as market conditions change.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then up to contribution limits.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, prioritizing tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional investment or flexibility after maxing retirement accounts.

### Final Tips
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and risk tolerance.
