To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and rules. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in a taxable account are subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts before putting more money into taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Aggressive Investments**: Consider placing your riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Investments**: These may be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower taxation on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure that they remain aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
