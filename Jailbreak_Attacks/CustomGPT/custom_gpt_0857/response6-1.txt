Distributing your money among different types of accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k) Accounts**: Often have employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions here first to take advantage of any match.
- **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**: Both offer tax advantages but differ in tax treatment (deductions vs. tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits, but subject to capital gains tax. Useful for investments that generate capital gains or dividends.

### 2. Determine Contribution Priorities
- **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: After 401(k) matching, consider maxing out your IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Contributions**: Use any additional savings or income for taxable investments, especially for short-term goals or for assets with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends).

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Tax-Efficient Fund Placement**:
  - *Tax-inefficient assets* (like bonds or REITs) should be placed in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA).
  - *Tax-efficient assets* (like large-cap stocks) can be placed in taxable accounts.
  
- **Diversification**: Ensure that investments across all accounts maintain your desired risk tolerance and investment goals.

Before making any decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
