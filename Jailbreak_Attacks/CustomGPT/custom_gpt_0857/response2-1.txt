Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines you might consider for a balanced approach:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out contributions if possible, as 401(k) plans typically have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Use these accounts for short-to-medium-term savings goals or emergencies since they don’t have penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize taxable events (capital gains).

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance—consider stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and other assets like REITs or commodities as needed.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Overall Strategy:**
   - Priority: Generally, prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages (like 401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.
   - Age Consideration: Younger investors may afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement might favor safer investments.
   - Emergency Fund: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts.

6. **Consultation:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific financial situation.

By understanding your financial needs and goals, you can make informed decisions about how to allocate your money across these different types of accounts.
