Deciding how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and prioritize this for tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Consider your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the limit is $6,500 per year ($7,500 if 50 or over). Maximize this if possible, especially if you qualified for a Roth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments. Use them for goals with a shorter time horizon that arenâ€™t retirement-specific.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially if you plan to sell investments. Long-term holdings (over one year) are taxed at a lower rate than short-term.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to capture any employer match, followed by an IRA for additional tax advantages, and finally allocate any surplus to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you're diversified to mitigate risk. Consider various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
