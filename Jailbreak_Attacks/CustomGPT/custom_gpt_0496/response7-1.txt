When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and IRAs (Traditional): Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if rules are followed.
   - Taxable Accounts: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed as income.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, taking into account the tax efficiency of each account type. 

4. **Prioritize Accounts**: After maxing out employer matching contributions in your 401(k), you may want to contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth for tax-free growth) and then return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions if possible.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you expect to retire early, consider having more savings in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

6. **Adjust Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial goals or circumstances.
