To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching if available.
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you need tax deductions now, traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - Aim to max out contributions yearly if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with less favorable tax treatment (like bonds).
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding investments longer to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors to mitigate risks.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and hold lower-growth, tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: 50%
2. **IRA**: 30%
3. **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Adjust based on personal financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
