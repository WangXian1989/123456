Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize taxes and growth. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for high contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider this for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains (these are taxed at lower rates).
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth assets like stocks or mutual funds since they will grow tax-deferred.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary; a financial advisor can tailor strategies to your unique situation.

Following this approach can help balance growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
