To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Traditional)**: These accounts allow tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributing if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs. Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you may need access to cash soon.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to minimize risk.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% up to the maximum employer match
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
