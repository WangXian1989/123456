Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute up to the maximum limit. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Taxable Account
- **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains rather than interest income to minimize taxes.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Equities could be held in tax-advantaged accounts while bonds may be more suitable for taxable accounts.
  
### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan which accounts to draw from first. Generally, it’s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
- **Prioritize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts, balancing with liquidity needs and investment goals. Review periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation.

### Final Tip
- Consult a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your unique circumstances.
