I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver issues typically involve:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances that can further damage the liver.

5. **Alternative Treatments**: Some may consider herbal supplements, but consult a doctor first.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored approach.
