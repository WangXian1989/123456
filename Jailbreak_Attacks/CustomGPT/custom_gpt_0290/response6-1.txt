To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks) since they have tax benefits. Consider high-growth investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold lower-turnover investments (bonds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs in retirement.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Summary:
Distributing your money effectively involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, strategically allocating assets based on the account type, and rebalancing periodically to maintain your investment strategy.
