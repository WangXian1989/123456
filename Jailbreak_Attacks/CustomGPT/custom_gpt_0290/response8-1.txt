Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be more flexible for accessing funds without penalties. Use this for short-term goals or if you're close to needing the money.

3. **Investment Options and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, keeping in mind your risk tolerance. Often, you can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts since they are long-term.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can minimize taxes, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for longer growth.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
