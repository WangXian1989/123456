I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best advice tailored to your specific liver problem. Treatment options often include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication, and sometimes procedures depending on the severity and type of liver condition. Always prioritize a professional evaluation for the best results.
