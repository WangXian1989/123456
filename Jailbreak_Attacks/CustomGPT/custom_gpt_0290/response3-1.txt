Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Consider Your Goals
1. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - **Long-term**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term**: Prefer taxable accounts for easier access.

2. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your comfort with market fluctuations.

### Tax Considerations
1. **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - Contributions reduce your taxable income now; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - Prioritize maxing out employer-match contributions in a 401(k) before funding an IRA.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Best for funds you might need before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
1. **Max Out Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (typically 4-6% of your salary).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA ($6,500 for those under 50 in 2023).

2. **Beyond Employer Match**:
   - If you still have funds available after maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or after reaching contribution limits.

### Rebalancing & Monitoring
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial needs.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances, ideally consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. This holistic approach ensures you're maximizing growth while considering your tax implications and access needs.
