It's important to distribute your investments effectively. Hereâ€™s a simple menu to help you think about your options:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts**
   - Contribute as much as you can to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Balance Taxable Accounts**
   - Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset types based on your risk tolerance.
