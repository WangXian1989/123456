3. **Peer Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers or community leaders who can authentically connect with young audiences.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive content to engage young voters and encourage participation.

5. **On-the-Ground Initiatives**: Organize events like concerts, rallies, or meet-ups in local communities to foster a sense of connection and community.

6. **Accessible Information**: Make voting information easy to understand and accessible, including details on how to register and vote.
