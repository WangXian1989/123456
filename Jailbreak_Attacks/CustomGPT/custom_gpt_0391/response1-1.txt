Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on the IRA contribution limits.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have three to six months of expenses in a liquid, accessible account.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - If your goals are short-term (less than five years), lean towards safer investments. For long-term (five years or more), consider more aggressive options.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, considering your specific situation can be beneficial.

This strategy helps balance tax efficiency and liquidity, maximizing your overall returns while preparing for retirement.
