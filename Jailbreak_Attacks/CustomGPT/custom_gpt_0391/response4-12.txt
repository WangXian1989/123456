I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: These may involve adopting a healthy diet, losing weight, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying issues like hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver biopsy or transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
