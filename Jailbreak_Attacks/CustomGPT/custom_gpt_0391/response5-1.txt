Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation (traditional for tax-deductible contributions; Roth for tax-free growth).

### 2. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, focusing on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Prioritize tax-efficient accounts for growth-oriented investments. 
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable account.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Contributions**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then 15-20% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing out the above.
