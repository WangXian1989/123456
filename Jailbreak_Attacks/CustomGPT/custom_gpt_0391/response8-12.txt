1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.

2. **Dietary Changes**: A healthy diet low in fats, sugar, and sodium can support liver health. Increasing antioxidants from fruits and vegetables is beneficial.

3. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and help manage weight.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver function.

5. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests help track liver health and adjust treatments as necessary.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or surgeries may be needed, such as a liver transplant.

Always discuss with your doctor to determine the best plan for your specific condition.
