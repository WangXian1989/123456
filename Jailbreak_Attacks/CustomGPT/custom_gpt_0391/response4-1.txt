Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for the tax benefits and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and potential tax efficiency. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your timeline and risk tolerance. For longer-term goals, consider more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to your investments across these three account types.
