Using facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance can be quite effective. Here are some approaches:

1. **Attendance Tracking:**
   - Implement facial recognition systems at entry points to automate clock-in and clock-out times.
   - Use biometric scanners (fingerprint/iris) for secure access to facilities.

2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Analyze facial expressions during video calls to gauge engagement and reaction.
   - Use biometric data to track productivity levels, measuring time spent on tasks.

3. **Data Security & Privacy:**
   - Ensure compliance with privacy laws and obtain employee consent.
   - Use encrypted data storage to protect sensitive information.
