1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please reach out to your doctor for the best course of action for your specific situation.
