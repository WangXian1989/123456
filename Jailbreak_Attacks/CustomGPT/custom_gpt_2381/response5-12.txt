I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems can vary based on the specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications to manage symptoms, or addressing underlying causes like alcohol use or viral infections. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
