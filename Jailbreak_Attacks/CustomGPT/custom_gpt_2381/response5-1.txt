To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA if eligible, as they offer tax benefits.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, spreading across asset classes in each account type.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation!
