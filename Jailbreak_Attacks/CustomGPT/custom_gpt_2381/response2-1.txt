Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) for long-term investments.
3. **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds).
4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal needs; different accounts have different tax implications.
5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and goals.
