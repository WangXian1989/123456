1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions for tax benefits.

2. **Balance for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments you may sell.
   - Keep long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Invest Accordingly:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter interest.
