To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer's match first. This is essentially "free money." Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Balance between aggressive growth and stable income.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategies as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
