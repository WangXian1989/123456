To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute above the match, focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. A traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maximizing retirement accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement, prioritizing tax-efficient withdrawals to minimize taxes owed.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.
