Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax benefits, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not provide immediate tax advantages but offer flexibility. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, tax implications, and changes in financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
