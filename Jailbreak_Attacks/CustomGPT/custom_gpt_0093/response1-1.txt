To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before investing in taxable accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth investments which may generate capital gains, deferring taxes.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
