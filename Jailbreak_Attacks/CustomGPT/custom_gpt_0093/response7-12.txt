I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment.
