Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth) for tax-advantaged growth, especially if you're eligible.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k), particularly if you are in a high tax bracket to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investment options outside retirement accounts, providing flexibility for short-term needs.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Allocate bonds and other interest-generating assets to tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. Stocks are often better suited for taxable accounts due to potential lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
