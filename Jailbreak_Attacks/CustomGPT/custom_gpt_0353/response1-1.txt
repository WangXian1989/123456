Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax savings now.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts will be taxed on dividends and capital gains, whereas the 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

5. **Adjust based on your age and risk tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards stocks in the 401(k) and IRA, while older individuals might shift to bonds.

6. **Stay diversified**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific situation.
