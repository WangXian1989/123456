To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. For example, higher-risk assets may be more suitable in accounts like the 401(k) or Roth IRA, where you wonâ€™t touch the money for a while.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they remain aligned with your investment goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
