I'm here to help with code captures and snippets, but monitoring employee performance and attendance with biometric data can be a sensitive topic that involves privacy considerations. If you're looking to implement a coding solution related to biometric data, such as facial recognition algorithms or attendance systems, I can help with that.

Just let me know if you need any specific code snippets or technical guidance!
