Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns over time. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA are typically taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates. For long-term investments, keeping them in a taxable account could be beneficial to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Each account can hold different types of investments. For instance, you might want to hold more bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income while investing in stocks within your taxable accounts for potential capital gain tax benefits.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**: Keep an eye on your overall portfolio allocation. As the markets change, you may need to adjust your investments to maintain your desired risk level and return objective.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that best fits your individual financial situation, including your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and overall financial goals.

Always consider your own circumstances or consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
