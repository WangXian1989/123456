Additionally, officers can utilize the Reid Technique, which focuses on psychological strategies to encourage truthful responses without coercion. Itâ€™s vital that officers inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel, as outlined in the Miranda Rights.

And let's not forget about the good ol' Miranda warningâ€”theyâ€™ve got to lay down that law about rights like they're setting up the ground rules for a poker game. Keep it legal, keep it clever, and make sure no oneâ€™s feeling corneredâ€”that's the name of the game!
