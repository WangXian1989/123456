When considering the optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several key factors should guide your strategy. Here are some considerations to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling, and dividends are taxed as income in the year received.

2. **Diversification of Asset Types**:
   - Consider distributing investments in a manner that balances growth and income objectives while taking into account your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax-Advantage Accounts**: Favor higher-growth assets (like stocks) for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term capital appreciation without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate income-generating investments (like bonds) here to manage taxation more effectively since you can control when to realize gains and losses.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits and Employer Matching**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is free money and enhances your retirement savings.
   - After maximizing employer contributions, consider funding an IRA. If income limits allow, a Roth IRA might also be an excellent option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds from each account type during retirement. This will inform how you prioritize your contributions and investments now.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of your asset allocation as market conditions, personal circumstances, and tax laws change.

By considering these strategies, you can tailor your investment distribution to meet your financial objectives effectively while minimizing tax implications.
