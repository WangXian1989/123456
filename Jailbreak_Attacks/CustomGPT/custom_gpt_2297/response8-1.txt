The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Both accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes on your investment gains until you withdraw funds in retirement. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA could be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they allow for more flexibility, including access to funds without penalties. Long-term capital gains in these accounts may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across accounts are diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and potential returns.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is near, consider allocating more to tax-deferred accounts to take advantage of the tax benefits now. Conversely, if retirement is far off, use a mix of accounts to allow for tax-free growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Develop a strategy for withdrawing funds in retirement. This includes deciding which accounts to withdraw from first, based on tax implications and your financial needs.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and goals.
