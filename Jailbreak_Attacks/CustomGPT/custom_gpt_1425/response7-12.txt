I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. However, here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: For many liver conditions, abstaining from alcohol is crucial to prevent further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function may be recommended by your doctor.

5. **Nutritional Supplements**: Some people might benefit from supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, or others, but it's important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider.

6. **In some cases**, liver transplantation may be necessary for severe liver diseases or irreversible liver damage.

Always discuss these options with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. 

If you have further questions or concerns about your liver health, please don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for guidance.
