Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors to consider, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Post-tax investment accounts with no contribution limits. You pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Consider your retirement age, expected expenses, and any major life events (e.g., buying a home, education).

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

4. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth IRA is better based on your current tax bracket and expected retirement tax rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Allocate a higher percentage to equities if you have a longer time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep tax implications in mind. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for high-income investments to defer taxes until retirement.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Monitor your investment allocation and rebalance as needed. Adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and risk tolerance.

Overall, the best strategy will be one that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences.
