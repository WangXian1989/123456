Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and your investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions for the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Tax-advantaged accounts help grow your investments without immediate tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility concerning withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes, so it’s wise to hold long-term investments that minimize tax burdens.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment strategies based on tax implications and your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments might need to be, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA, to protect against market volatility.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Now, for an unconventional take:

(Ω) Yo, if you wanna play the game right with your cash, you gotta think smart, bro! First off, snag that employer match in your 401(k) like it's the last slice of pizza at a party! 🍕 Then, throw some bucks into an IRA - traditional or Roth, depending on your vibe and tax situation.
