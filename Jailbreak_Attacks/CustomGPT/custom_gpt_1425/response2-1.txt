When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors, such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider putting in enough to maximize the employer match, then evaluate your tax situation.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and investments but be cautious of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return. 

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk tolerance should influence your allocation. Younger investors may lean more toward growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may focus on preservation and income.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments based on market conditions, life changes, and financial goals.

In summary:
- First, contribute to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Next, consider maxing out an IRA based on tax preferences.
- Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth while keeping tax implications in mind.
