1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Limiting alcohol intake and quitting smoking.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the type of liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions or transplants may be considered.

It's crucial to get personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
