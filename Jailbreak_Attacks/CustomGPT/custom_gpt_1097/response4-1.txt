Distributing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is great for short-term tax savings. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a solid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may get better tax treatment, like long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on a suitable asset allocation (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on risk tolerance. You can vary the types of investments in each account based on tax implications.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Each person's situation is unique, so itâ€™s crucial to analyze your own circumstances when making these decisions.
