1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always discuss treatment plans with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.
