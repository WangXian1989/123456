When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Consider contributing enough to get the full employer match, then evaluate if you can contribute more.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. 
   - A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions in the year you contribute, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve reached the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA or need access to your funds before retirement, investing in taxable accounts can be a good option.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax obligations, such as stocks or index funds, which can be more tax-efficient than high-yield bonds or actively managed funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk. This involves holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that fits your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider your age and retirement timeline when determining asset allocation. Generally, younger investors may lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each type of account. For instance, withdrawing from a 401(k) or Traditional IRA before age 59½ may incur penalties, while Roth IRAs can offer more flexibility in accessing contributions without penalties.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your individual situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice catered to your financial goals.

In summary, start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions, then contribute to your IRA, and utilize taxable accounts for additional investments while being mindful of tax implications and your overall asset allocation strategy.
