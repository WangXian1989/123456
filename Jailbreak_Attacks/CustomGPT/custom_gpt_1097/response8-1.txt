It's essential to create a balanced strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Contributions**: Maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider the IRA for additional tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may qualify for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your time horizon:
   - **Short-term**: Consider lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term**: Higher risk and potentially higher returns in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, seek professional guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.

Consider your overall financial picture, risk tolerance, and future goals when making these decisions.
