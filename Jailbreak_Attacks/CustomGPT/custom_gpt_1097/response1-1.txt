The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as it offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you can afford it after contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or interest income, as they are taxed differently compared to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This can include stocks or funds you believe will appreciate long-term.

**Considerations**:
- Assess your short-term vs. long-term needs; 401(k)s and IRAs are meant for retirement, while taxable accounts can be more flexible.
- A balanced approach is often wise: prioritize your 401(k) for employer match, follow up with your IRA, and then any excess funds can go into taxable accounts.

**Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice based on your unique situation. Always remember to review and adjust your allocation as needed based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
