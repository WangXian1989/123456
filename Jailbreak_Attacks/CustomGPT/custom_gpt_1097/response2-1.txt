Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, but check income limits. This is beneficial if you are eligible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (like a savings account) to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts. They offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalty.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to balance risk and return.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals. If you're younger, you might lean more towards growth-focused investments, while conservative strategies may be better as you near retirement.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
