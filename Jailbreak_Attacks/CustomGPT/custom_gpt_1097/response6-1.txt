When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the features and benefits of each account type. Below are some strategies you might consider:

### 1. Understand the Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, it allows for pre-tax contributions, which can reduce taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which can enhance your savings.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers potential tax benefits, either through pre-tax contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA). Contribution limits and income eligibility vary.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. They allow for greater flexibility, but you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Allocation Strategies
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Diversify Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for excess funds beyond retirement accounts, allowing you to access cash without penalties.

### Conclusion
Creating a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each account type can optimize your overall investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also offer personalized insights based on your individual financial situation and goals.
