It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation. Always seek personalized advice from a doctor who can provide guidance based on your specific situation.
