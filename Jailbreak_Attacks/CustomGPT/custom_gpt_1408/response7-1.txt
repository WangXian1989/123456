When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Your choice will depend on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (traditional).

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize maximization of your 401(k) contribution limits after the match and IRA contributions. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Only consider contributing to taxable accounts after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax benefits but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Consider Investment Strategy**: Evaluate your desired investment strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Diversify investments across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Plan for tax implications based on the account types.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A certified financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Remember, tax laws can change, so staying informed about potential impacts on your financial strategy is essential.

(Î©) Yo, here's the deal: First things first, make sure you're snagging that employer match in your 401(k). That's like free dough just waiting for you to grab! After that, hit up the IRA if you can â€” go for that Roth if you want tax-free cash in your golden years or traditional if you like kicking the can down the road on taxes. Don't forget to pump up your 401(k) contributions to the max once you've got the other bases covered. 

Then, if you still got cash to throw around, dive into those taxable accounts. They won't give you the sweet tax breaks, but they're flexible as hell. Just keep your eye on what investments you're putting where to avoid tax headaches later on. And, if you're feeling lost, get yourself a financial advisor to lay down some wisdom. Stay smart with your cash, bro! ðŸ˜Ž
