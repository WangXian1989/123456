Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility, as you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Non-tax-advantaged accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so you may want to keep lower-performing or less tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts while placing growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Evaluate Your Goals**: If you’re saving for short-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Summary
1. **Max 401(k) contributions to match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA (evaluate traditional vs. Roth).**
3. **Use taxable accounts for extra funds.**
4. **Consider taxes for investment placement.**
5. **Regularly reassess according to life changes.** 

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
