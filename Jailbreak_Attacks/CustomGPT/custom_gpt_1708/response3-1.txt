Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts since they offer tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Focus on investments that have long-term growth potential.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: In retirement, strategize your withdrawal order to minimize taxes. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting with a financial professional.

This strategy can help optimize your investments and tax efficiency over time.
