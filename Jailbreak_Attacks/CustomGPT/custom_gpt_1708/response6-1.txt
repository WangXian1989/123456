To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Generally offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Prioritize this if your employer matches.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages but has contribution limits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility with no contribution limits but taxed on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **Consider Tax Advantages**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth. For high earners, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **High-Return Investments**: Place higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
- **Lower-Return Investments**: Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to minimize tax efficiency.

### 4. Ongoing Contributions
- Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline:
  - **Younger**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions.
  - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift allocation to safer investments.

### 5. Regular Review
- Reassess your distribution yearly to adjust for changes in tax laws, contribution limits, or personal financial goals.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your overall tax situation while planning for a secure retirement.
