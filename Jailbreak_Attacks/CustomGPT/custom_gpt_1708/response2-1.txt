Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax strategy and retirement savings. Here’s a guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, contributions are capped at $23,000 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (additional $1,000 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional accounts provide tax breaks now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexibility and immediate access. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a savings account before heavily investing.

6. **Review Regularly**: Make adjustments based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
