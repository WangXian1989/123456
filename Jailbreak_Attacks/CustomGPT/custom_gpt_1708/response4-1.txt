Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks held long-term for favorable capital gains rates or real estate investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, focusing on a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll take withdrawals in retirement. Generally, you might want to take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

Adjust contributions as your income and financial goals change over time.
