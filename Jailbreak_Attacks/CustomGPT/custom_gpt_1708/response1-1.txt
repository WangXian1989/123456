Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable if you have a good investment choice. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Fund a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're over the income limit, focus on a traditional IRA or consider a backdoor Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and market changes.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to potentially reduce your tax burden.
