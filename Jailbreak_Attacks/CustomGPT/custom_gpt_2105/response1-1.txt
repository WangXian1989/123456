Distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you allocate funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which means they lower your taxable income now but you'll owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After getting any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) as they generally have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - If you're looking for long-term growth and can leave your money invested, focus on retirement accounts.
   - If you need access to funds before retirement or want to invest in taxable accounts, maintain a smaller allocation there.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments within each account. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs, depending on your risk tolerance.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this general advice to your specific situation.
