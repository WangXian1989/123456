Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings and investments beyond retirement accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA): These allow your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal. They might be ideal for higher-income years when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these donâ€™t provide the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) since taxes aren't a concern until withdrawal.
   - Use more stable, income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities from interest and dividends.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Long-term investments should be placed in retirement accounts to maximize growth.
   - Short-term savings or goals within a few years might be better suited for taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your financial situation, investment performance, and changing tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances can also be very helpful.
