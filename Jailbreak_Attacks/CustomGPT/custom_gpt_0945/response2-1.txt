Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially "free money." For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions as well. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)/Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (under certain conditions). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed, so use these for investments you plan to hold for the long term.

3. **Focus on Investment Growth**:
   - Invest for growth in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), where the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those that generate regular income, as these will incur taxes annually.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify holdings across all accounts. Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) and their allocations in each account based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to protect your capital.
   - Young investors can afford to take more risks with higher growth potential in their 401(k) and IRAs.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By strategically allocating your contributions and considering both tax implications and investment growth, you can optimize your retirement savings effectively.
