Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. A Roth 401(k) or IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider your expected tax bracket at retirement when deciding where to invest.

3. **Diversification Across Asset Types**:
   - Aim for a balanced asset allocation that includes stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts. This can help manage risk and target growth.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might favor more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA for growth. As you approach retirement, you might shift to more conservative investments in those accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a separate account before heavily investing in these other accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**:
   - Have a plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

By carefully balancing your contributions and withdrawals across these accounts, you can work towards optimizing your tax efficiency and investment growth.
