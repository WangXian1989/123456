Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Roth IRAs (if eligible)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and contributing to a Roth IRA, direct any additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Traditional IRAs**: If you're looking for tax deductions now, consider contributing to a traditional IRA after optimizing contributions to your 401(k).

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for short to medium-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. This is also beneficial if you require liquidity before retirement.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider the balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
