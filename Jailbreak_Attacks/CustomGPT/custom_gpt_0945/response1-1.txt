Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, max out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on which you qualify for and your tax situation). IRAs often provide more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After funding your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains rates or that you might want to access before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your asset allocation—how much you invest in stocks versus bonds—should vary based on your risk tolerance and age. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those nearing retirement might prefer safer investments.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that money in 401(k)s and IRAs grows tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth), so it can be beneficial to max these out before contributing to taxable accounts. Also, be aware of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you optimize growth while managing taxes and risk!
