Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. 

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and making IRA contributions, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are useful for short- to medium-term goals and can provide flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations yearly to adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

Overall, tailor your strategy to align with your specific goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeframe. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your situation.
