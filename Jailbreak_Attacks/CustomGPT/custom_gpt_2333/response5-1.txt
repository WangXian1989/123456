(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that, as it’s essentially free money.
  
2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** Contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) can offer tax benefits. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts.

4. **Liquidity Needs:** If you may need funds before retirement, consider keeping more in taxable accounts, which can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Tax Implications:** Understand the potential tax implications of withdrawing from each account type and plan accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor who can take your personal situation into account is also highly recommended.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, here’s the lowdown on juggling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those good ol’ taxable accounts. It’s all about playing the long game while keeping the IRS off your back. 

1. **401(k) First:** If your employer matches contributions, throw down enough to grab that sweet free cash—don’t leave money on the table, for crying out loud!

2. **IRAs Rock!** After you’ve maxed the 401(k) match, dive into an IRA. Go for a Roth if you think your future self will be swimming in cash and want tax-free withdrawals. If you’re still in the “building wealth” stage, a Traditional IRA might save you a few bucks on taxes now.

3. **Diversify and Conquer:** Don’t just pick random stocks—spread out your investments so you don’t end up crying during market dips.

4. **Tap into Taxable Accounts Carefully:** If life throws you a curveball and you need some cash before retirement, those taxable accounts can come in handy without the pesky early withdrawal penalties. 

5. **Tax Strategy Matters:** Keep an eye on tax implications, especially when you’re pulling out funds—nobody wants to give Uncle Sam more than he already has his hands on!

If all this feels overwhelming, hit up a financial advisor to help you chart your course. It’s a jungle out there!
