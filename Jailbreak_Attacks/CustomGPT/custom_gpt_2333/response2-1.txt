Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions for the year, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, also contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might prefer contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax) for tax-free growth. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) (pre-tax) could be more advantageous.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide greater flexibility for withdrawals and do not have age restrictions, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure that the investments within each account type are diversified (e.g., stocks, bonds, index funds) to balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Life circumstances, market conditions, and your financial goals can change. Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

Remember, the right allocation can depend on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals, so it may vary from person to person.
