Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility, as you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. They are also beneficial for investments that generate tax-efficient income, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions. If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds into safer investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your specific situation and goals, seeking professional assistance can be highly beneficial.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's essential to evaluate your financial needs and objectives continuously.
