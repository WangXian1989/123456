To distribute money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Generally, focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars and can grow tax-free. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable events (like dividends or short-term capital gains). Keep in mind that dividends from stocks held long-term can be taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account for unforeseen expenses.

3. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement horizon and related goals to determine how much to allocate to each account type according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across accounts, considering asset allocation that aligns with your long-term goals, overall tax situation, and market conditions.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your strategy to adapt to changing tax laws, life circumstances, and investment performance.

Ultimately, your specific allocation should reflect your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that suits your unique situation.
