To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, factor that into your tax planning.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA). This can minimize the tax impact since these accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation suits your risk tolerance and investment goals. Distribute investments like stocks, bonds, and alternative assets across your accounts to maintain this balance.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. This may involve shifting funds among accounts based on performance and your changing goals.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits and Rules**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account to avoid penalties. This can influence how much you allocate to each type of account annually.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw from these accounts. Typically, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

It may also be helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique financial situation and goals. Would you like more detailed information on any specific aspect?
