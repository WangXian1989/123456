Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can enhance your investment strategy and optimize your tax situation. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions up to the annual limit, which is higher than that of IRAs.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available within your 401(k) for fees and performance.

### 2. **Traditional IRA**
   - **Tax Deduction**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Usually offers a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Consider Conversion to Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider converting to a Roth IRA (taxes due at conversion).

### 3. **Roth IRA**
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits and Income Caps**: Be aware of the contribution limits and your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) to qualify.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals, making it great for short-term or medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax; holding investments for over a year can minimize this tax rate.
   - **Dividend Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks that produce qualified dividends.

### **General Strategy for Distribution**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA (especially if a Roth is available), and finally allocate funds to a taxable account as needed.
- **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk better.
- **Regular Review**: Continuously assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to match limit)
- **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Max contribution ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maximizing the above accounts
