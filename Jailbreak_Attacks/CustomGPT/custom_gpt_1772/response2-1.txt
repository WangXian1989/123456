Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contribute Enough to Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is free money.
   - **Consider High Contribution Limits**: 401(k) accounts generally have higher contribution limits than IRAs, allowing for significant tax-deferred savings.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Use Roth IRAs if Possible**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA Contributions**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Diversification and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, such as bonds, and to maintain flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable distributions.

### 4. **General Strategies:**
   - **Balance Growth and Risk**: Consider the risk and return profiles of your investments across all accounts. Stocks generally offer higher growth potential but with greater volatility.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, goals, and changing circumstances.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions first** to the limit or employer match.
- **Next, focus on maximizing IRA contributions**, especially if you can utilize a Roth IRA.
- **Finally, invest in taxable accounts**, focusing on investments that complement your tax strategies from the retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution will vary per individual circumstance, so consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan suited to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals is advisable.
