Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50). If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) across both Traditional and Roth IRAs.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received, and capital gains taxes apply when selling investments.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon (short vs. long term) and risk tolerance when choosing investments. Generally, longer horizons allow for a more aggressive approach.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Make sure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Each account can hold different types of assets based on your strategy.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets aside from retirement accounts for emergencies (usually 3-6 months of expenses).

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation and performance annually or biannually to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 40% (max out match if available)
- **IRA**: 20% (consider which type suits you best)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40% (focus on tax-efficient investments)

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, tailoring your distribution strategy to your personal situation will yield the best results. If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
