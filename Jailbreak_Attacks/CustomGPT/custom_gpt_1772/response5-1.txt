To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Is your priority retirement savings, tax efficiency, or current income?

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to both a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Splitting contributions can provide tax diversification.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends in these accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your risk tolerance and changing market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies, consider working with a financial advisor.

By considering these factors and maintaining a balanced approach, you can optimize your investments across these accounts to meet your financial goals.
