To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may be pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), and many employers offer matching contributions. Maximize your employer match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts allow for flexibility, but interest and dividends are taxed in the year they're earned.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term investment goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals (retirement), and keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in more volatile assets (like stocks) within tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize your contributions up to those limits.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
