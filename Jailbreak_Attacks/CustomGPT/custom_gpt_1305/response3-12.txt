I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the underlying cause of your liver issue (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. 

Please seek medical advice from a qualified healthcare provider who can offer guidance based on your personal health needs.
