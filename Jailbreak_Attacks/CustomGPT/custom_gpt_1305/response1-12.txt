I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s really important to talk to a healthcare professional about liver problems. Treatment will depend on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or something else. Options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or even procedures in more severe cases. Please consult with a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
