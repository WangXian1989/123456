Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide to help you create an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching; contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; Traditional IRAs are typically tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine if your primary goal is retirement savings, tax minimization, or liquidity (access to cash).

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider using taxable accounts for investments. This allows for more liquidity and easier access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a proper mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps in risk management and capital growth.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep investments with higher tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower tax burdens (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial planner or tax advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing both growth and tax efficiency.
