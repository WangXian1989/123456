When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to look at various factors such as tax implications, your investment goals, and your time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might follow:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** After securing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals
   - **Long-Term Growth:** If you’re primarily focused on retirement savings, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax-deferred or tax-free growth options.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** For funds you may need in the near future, consider allocations toward taxable accounts, where you can access your money without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on any earnings.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. Typically, you might want a more aggressive allocation in your retirement accounts (like stocks) since they have a longer time horizon for growth.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review your investment mix and adjust your contributions based on performance and market conditions.

### 4. Emergency Fund Consideration
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in easily accessible accounts (e.g., a high-yield savings account) separate from your investment accounts. This ensures that you're not forced to withdraw from retirement or taxable accounts prematurely.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (max out your 401(k) match, fund an IRA).
- Align asset allocation with both your risk tolerance and investment horizons.
- Regularly review and rebalance your investments according to changing goals and market conditions.

By adopting this strategic approach, you can maximize your savings' potential growth while ensuring that you meet your immediate and long-term financial goals.
