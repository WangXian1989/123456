It's important to consider several factors when deciding the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key points to help guide your decision:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs typically allow for pre-tax contributions, similar to a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, as well as taxes on dividends and interest income in the year they are received.

2. **Growth Potential**: 
   - Consider how each account type aligns with your investment goals. Typically, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) are better suited for long-term growth without immediate tax consequences. 

3. **Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Taxable accounts offer more liquidity than retirement accounts, allowing you to access funds without penalties at any time.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type, as well as any employer match offerings in your 401(k) plan, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.

5. **Investment Options**: 
   - 401(k) plans can have limited investment options compared to IRAs and taxable accounts, which can influence where you want to allocate your money.

6. **Personal Financial Goals**: 
   - Assess your personal financial situation, including your age, risk tolerance, overall financial goals, and when you plan to retire.

Given these factors, a balanced approach could involve maximizing contributions to employer-sponsored plans (like 401(k)) to take advantage of any matching contributions, then prioritizing IRAs, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, and finally allocating any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your unique financial situation.
