The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is basically free money and should be considered a priority.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Money in a 401(k) or traditional IRA grows tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes until you withdraw it. This is beneficial for retirement planning.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: With taxable accounts, you're subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals. You can invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Assess how much risk you’re willing to take and your investment time horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative investments might be appropriate for a taxable account.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider what types of investments to hold in each account based on tax efficiency. It’s often advantageous to hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping growth stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and your overall asset allocation. You might need to rebalance your portfolio to ensure that you're staying aligned with your investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will depend on your individual goals, preferences, and circumstances.
