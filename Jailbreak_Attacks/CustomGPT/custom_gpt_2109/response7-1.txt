The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed to optimize your tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you qualify for IRA contributions, prioritize either a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (for tax deductions on contributions).
   - Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA once you've captured your employer match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings in this account for easy access without penalties.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Aggressive Saver**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the match, fully fund your IRA, then put excess savings in taxable accounts.
- **Balanced Approach**: Contribute a mix to your 401(k) and IRA, gradually increasing investments in taxable accounts as your savings grow.
- **Emergency Fund Priority**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

Ultimately, tailoring your approach to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications is key to effective distribution.
