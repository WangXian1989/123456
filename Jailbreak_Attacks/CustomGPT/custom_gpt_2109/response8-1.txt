Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize High-Deductible Accounts**:
   - Max out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before adding money to taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits critical for long-term growth.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Consider putting investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping investments with lower taxable distributions (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your portfolio within each account type by balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Tax-efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your changing goals, market conditions, and performance of your investments.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual’s financial situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and strategies when deciding how to allocate your investments.
