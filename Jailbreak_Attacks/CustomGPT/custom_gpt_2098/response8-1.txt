The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides possible immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These give you more flexibility and access to your money before retirement without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts. Typically, higher-risk investments (stocks) are better suited for retirement accounts due to their long-term growth potential, while more conservative investments (bonds or cash) may be appropriate for taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications:
   - **Capital Gains**: Investments in taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes when sold.
   - **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the rules for withdrawals from each account type.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually in response to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that aligns with your unique circumstances.
