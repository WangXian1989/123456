Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offered by employers with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account—with traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth options (taxed upfront, tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages but greater flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maxing your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - If applicable, continue contributing to your 401(k) to increase your retirement savings.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts:** Contributions reduce taxable income now but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Pay taxes now, enjoy tax-free growth. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short-term goals or immediate needs, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 5. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-/Medium-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for more flexible access.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then aim for a maximum contribution.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to the IRA.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest additional funds after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
