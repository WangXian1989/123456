Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. Evaluate Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you might need to access before retirement, as they offer more flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Tolerance
- Ensure your investments across all accounts reflect your risk tolerance and diversification strategy. Stocks in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial since they can grow tax-deferred.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement, as this can affect how much you contribute to each type of account. 

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy across all accounts.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute a fixed percentage (e.g., 15% of your income).
- **IRA**: Aim for the maximum contribution yearly ($6,500 for individuals under 50 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional savings towards this for immediate liquidity and investment options.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
