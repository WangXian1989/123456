Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.
   
### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include stocks and ETFs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These are beneficial for high-income years since contributions reduce taxable income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You might choose more liquid investments here, such as stocks or funds that you can sell without penalty.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- If you can contribute 15% of your income to retirement:
  - 5% to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
  - 5% to your IRA.
  - 5% to the 401(k) up to the limit after employer match or back to the taxable accounts for more flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
