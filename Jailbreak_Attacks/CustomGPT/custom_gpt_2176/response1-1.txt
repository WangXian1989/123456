Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a smart way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible) after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs can provide tax advantages that help your investments grow.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider using any additional savings to fund a taxable investment account. This gives you more flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties, although you will owe capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell your investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors typically can afford to take more risks (more equities), while those closer to retirement may want to adopt a more conservative strategy (more bonds).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, make sure you have an emergency fund that covers at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This protects you from needing to dip into retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
