The best approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which option fits your tax strategy best.

3. **Return to 401(k):** Once you've funded any IRAs, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, taking advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** If you still have money to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is beneficial for flexibility, as funds can be accessed without withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio within each account, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** As you distribute your investments, remember the tax implications of each account. For example, it might be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and higher-income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly reassess your financial situation and retirement goals to make adjustments as necessary.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
