I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver issue. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgical interventions. Here are a few approaches that are often considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the underlying cause, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol, which can impact liver health.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In cases of cirrhosis or liver tumors, a doctor may recommend surgical options, including liver transplant.

It's crucial to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine what is appropriate for your specific situation.
