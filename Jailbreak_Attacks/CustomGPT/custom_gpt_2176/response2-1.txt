Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions allow for tax-free growth (similar to a Roth IRA).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting that money in a taxable account. These accounts are more flexible regarding withdrawals but have tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification and Allocation**: Depending on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals, allocate your investments accordingly. For example, younger investors might prioritize growth-oriented funds (stocks), while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments (bonds).

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment distribution and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or personal goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help you create a holistic plan that factors in your overall financial picture.

Make sure to keep tax implications and future financial needs in mind as you make your decisions.
