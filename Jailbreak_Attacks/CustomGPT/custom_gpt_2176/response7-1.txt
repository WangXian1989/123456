Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, employer matching contributions, and investment options available. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free (in the case of Roth), which can be beneficial depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages like the retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility and liquidity. Gains are taxed as capital gains, which could be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Diversification of Investment**: Allocate your investments based on the time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to invest in more aggressive assets (stocks) in accounts that provide tax advantages, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. More conservative investments (bonds) could be placed in taxable accounts, especially those generating interest income, as they are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Some strategies suggest withdrawing from taxable accounts first, as they do not have penalties for early withdrawal like 401(k)s and IRAs do (before age 59½). Afterwards, you can withdraw from your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: It’s important to review your allocations regularly and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
