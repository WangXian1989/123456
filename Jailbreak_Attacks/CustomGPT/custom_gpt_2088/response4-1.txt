Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contributions, consider maxing this out next. Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Based on your risk tolerance, allocate assets across all accounts. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds. Consider tax implications based on your retirement income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your desired asset mix.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
