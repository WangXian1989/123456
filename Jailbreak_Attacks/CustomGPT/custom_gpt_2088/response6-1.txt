To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k) Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:** Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Objectives**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Allocate more to growth-oriented investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like a 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to reduce volatility.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:** Strategize when and how to withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize tax liabilities. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions for long-term growth.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 30% based on tax strategy preferences.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion
Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended for personalized advice.
