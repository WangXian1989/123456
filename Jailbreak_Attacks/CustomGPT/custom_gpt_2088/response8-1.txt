Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you need tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of lower contribution limits and the income phase-out for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Maintain a taxable account for short-term goals or emergencies, as funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
1. **Prioritize**: Start with contributions to the 401(k) up to the match, then max out an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
2. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and personal circumstances.
3. **Long-Term Focus**: Invest for the long term to benefit from compound growth.

### Consider Your Situation
- **Age & Time Horizon**: Younger investors can afford to take more risks, while older investors should prioritize stability.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort with volatility should guide your investment choices across all accounts.
