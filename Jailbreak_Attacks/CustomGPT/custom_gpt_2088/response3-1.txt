Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to max out contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those 50+) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a catch-up of $1,000).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within these accounts, ensure that you diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may appreciate over time or generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and performance to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, and rebalance as necessary.

### Summary
- Contribute enough to 401(k) for the full employer match.
- Max out contributions to IRA and 401(k) if able.
- Diversify investments within these accounts.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing tax-advantaged options.
