The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several individual factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRAs:**
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may qualify for a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA:** With a traditional IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility. Investments held over a year benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk. This typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset types based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Prioritize tax-efficient withdrawals to minimize taxable income. Generally, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) last.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and needs.

Determining the optimal distribution will require consideration of your current financial situation, future income projections, and retirement goals. Regularly reviewing your strategy, especially as tax laws and personal circumstances change, is also essential.
