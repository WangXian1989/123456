Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important aspect of your overall investment strategy and retirement planning. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your financial goals (retirement savings, buying a home, etc.) and time frame for when you'll need the funds.

2. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), depending on the plan.
     - Employers may match contributions, which is free money.
     - Early withdrawal penalties may apply before age 59Â½.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
     - Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible; withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
     - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
     - Income limits may affect Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - No tax advantages initially; investments are subject to capital gains tax.
     - More flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then consider IRAs. This helps you take advantage of tax benefits.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected tax situation in retirement. A mix of pre-tax and post-tax accounts can provide flexibility.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Especially if you are unsure about the best distribution strategy, a financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your unique situation.

In summary, prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax benefits, diversify across account types, regularly review your allocations, and consider consulting with a professional.
