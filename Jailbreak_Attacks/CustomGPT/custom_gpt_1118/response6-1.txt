Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maxing out contributions can also lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you are eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth. If you prefer a traditional IRA, focus on tax deductions at your current tax rate.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) or for funds you may need before retirement age without penalties.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation
   - **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks and enhance returns. Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust allocations across accounts to maintain your target asset allocation, especially as markets fluctuate.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best approach involves a combination of maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while also maintaining liquidity and flexibility in your taxable accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
