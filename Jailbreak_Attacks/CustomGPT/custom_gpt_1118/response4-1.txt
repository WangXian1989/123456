When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to focus on a few key principles of investment allocation, tax efficiency, and your specific financial goals. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically an employer-sponsored plan allowing you to invest pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. Many employers also offer matching contributions, so maximizing your contributions to at least get the full match is advisable.
   - **IRA** (Individual Retirement Account): Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. The choice between these depends on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages, but they provide flexibility and liquidity. Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, which can impact your overall tax strategy.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Once these tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out or sufficiently funded, you can direct additional funds into your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - If your retirement is many years away, you might position a more aggressive portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts (due to their long-term growth potential and tax optimization). Conversely, if you expect to need funds before retirement, keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold lower-yielding or tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts where their tax implications will be more favorable in long-term horizon contexts. 

5. **Investment Mix**:
   - Regularly review your overall asset allocation across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This helps maintain a balanced portfolio.

6. **Tax Harvesting**:
   - In your taxable account, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses for tax purposes.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, including income level, financial goals, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor may also be beneficial to tailor your investment distribution plan specifically to your circumstances.
