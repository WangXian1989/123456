To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching; contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, with contributions made post-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed on capital gains and dividends; more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Max out Roth IRA (if eligible):** If your income allows, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Back to 401(k):** If you have extra funds, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax burdens (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow).

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor your investment allocations annually and adjust as necessary based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies based on your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can enhance your growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
