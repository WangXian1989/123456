Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Treatment**: Each account type has different tax implications. 401(k) and IRAs (traditional and Roth) offer tax advantages but have different rules on withdrawals. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.
- **Investment Goals**: Define whether you’re saving for short-term needs, long-term growth, or retirement specific targets. 

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After you’ve secured the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Aim for the maximum allowable contribution limits for both the 401(k) and IRA.

3. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, stocks have higher potential returns (and volatility), while bonds are more stable.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize taxable events.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### General Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 50% of total investment or up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
- **Personalization Is Key**: Tailor the distribution based on individual circumstances, such as age, income, and financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, particularly dealing with complex tax situations or investment strategies.

This distribution strategy can enhance your overall investment returns while optimizing your tax situation for future withdrawals.
