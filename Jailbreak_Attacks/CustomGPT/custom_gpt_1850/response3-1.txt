To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it allows for tax-deductible contributions, with taxes owed at withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Know the contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize your contributions, starting with the employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts typically benefit from longer-term investments and potential tax-free growth (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable accounts** can be used for investments that may generate short-term gains or income, as they are taxed differently.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account. Younger individuals may prefer higher-risk investments in 401(k)s and IRAs, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stable funds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts before age 59Â½ can incur penalties, so ensure you have liquidity in your taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly; a financial advisor can help tailor strategies to your specific financial situation.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, understand the contributions and tax implications, align investments with your financial goals, and consider consulting a professional for personalized guidance.
