Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to guide you:

### 1. Understand the Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, can have matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), impacting taxes at withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth) have tax advantages; contributions may be deductible, and Roth contributions grow tax-free.
- **Taxable Account**: Offers flexibility and no contribution limits, but earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **401(k) Matches First**: Contribute enough to get the employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA before increasing 401(k) contributions beyond the match, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which has tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **401(k) Maximum Contribution**: If you can afford to, consider maxing out your 401(k) after fully funding your IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you hit contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-free growth.
- **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or dividend stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. Tax Considerations:
- Be mindful of the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account type.
- Diversifying across account types can provide flexibility in retirement to manage tax liabilities.

### 5. Review Regularly:
- Reassess your allocations based on life changes (e.g., job changes, family status) and market conditions.
- Ensure your investment choices align with both your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach considers the advantages of each account type, prioritizes contributions effectively, and optimizes your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
