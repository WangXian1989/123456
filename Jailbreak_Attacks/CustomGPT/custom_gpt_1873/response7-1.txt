Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Pay Attention to Taxes**:
   - Consider placing investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on long-term investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts.
   - Diversify investments across all account types to mitigate risk and maximize growth potential.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

This strategy will help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
