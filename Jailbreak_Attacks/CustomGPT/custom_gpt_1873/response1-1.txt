Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.
- **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Use this account for long-term growth investments.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional/Roth)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs give tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Know the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Money can be accessed at any time without penalties. Use this for short- to medium-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Favor long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
- **Diversification**: This is a good place for investments that might produce income (like dividend stocks) since you can manage their tax implications.

### **General Strategy**
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) since they benefit most from tax deferral.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavy investing in these accounts.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on market performance and changing life circumstances.

### **Final Thoughts**
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy based on your unique situation, the specific benefits of each account, and your overall financial plan.
