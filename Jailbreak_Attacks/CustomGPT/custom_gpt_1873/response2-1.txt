Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions by Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate qualified dividends (which are taxed at a lower rate).
   - **Bonds or High-Yield Investments:** Hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable interest income.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds that you will need in the next few years in your taxable accounts or cash equivalents.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 10-20% of your income, maxing out to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed, depending on your income and tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on long-term growth investments and cash reserves.

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Planner:** Personalized advice can help tailor your accounts to your specific financial situation.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with changes in tax laws and contribution limits that may affect your strategy.

This approach helps balance growth potential with tax efficiency while ensuring that you're prepared for both short- and long-term financial needs.
