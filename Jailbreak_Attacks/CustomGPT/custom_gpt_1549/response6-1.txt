To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Considerations
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free during retirement. Evaluate your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from these accounts are taxed in the year they are realized, but long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. Contribution Limits and Benefits
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:** If you are further from retirement, a Roth IRA may provide more long-term tax advantages compared to a Traditional IRA or 401(k).
   - **Diversification of Tax Strategy:** Ensure a mix of accounts that will provide flexibility in managing your tax burden in retirement.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
- **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate funds to your taxable account for liquidity and access without penalties.
- **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth, starting with maxing out your employer match on your 401(k).
- **Regular Reviews:** Annually review and adjust your distribution according to changes in tax laws, retirement goals, and personal financial situations.

This diversified approach can help balance your overall tax burden while allowing for accessible funds in the short term.
