Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guide to help you strategize your distribution:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where you pay taxes on gains and dividends in the year they're realized. More flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without the immediate tax burden.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for the order in which you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time until retirement. Younger investors generally take more risks, while those closer to retirement focus on capital preservation.

6. **Regular Review:**
   - Continually review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** max out to employer match
- **IRA:** max out contributions
- **Taxable Account:** any additional savings

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
