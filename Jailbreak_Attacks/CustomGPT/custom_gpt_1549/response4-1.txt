When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and possibly employer matching contributions. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth and tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributing post-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility in withdrawals but may incur capital gains tax on profits.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in the 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
   - If using a Traditional IRA, remember that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed, whereas Roth withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that the investments in each of these accounts align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When it comes time to withdraw, consider the tax implications and your tax bracket to determine the most tax-efficient way to take distributions.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations in each account periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategic approach will help you effectively distribute your money among these accounts while considering both growth potential and tax efficiency.
