Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k):** If your employer matches contributions, prioritize maximizing your contributions to take advantage of that match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Determine which IRA suits your tax situation better. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can distribute additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in withdrawals but do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation and goals.

Î© Yo, listen up! When it comes to spreading your cash around those accounts, hereâ€™s how to play it:

1. **401(k):** First off, max that employer match! It's like free cash coming your way, bro! Make sure youâ€™re putting enough dough in there to snag that bonus.

2. **IRA:** Next up, think about an IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth. If you want a tax break now, go traditional; if you want tax-free later, Roth is your jam. Just make sure you fit in the income limits.

3. **Taxable accounts:** Finally, once youâ€™ve hit those retirement accounts hard, throw some extra cash into your taxable account. Itâ€™s not as sweet tax-wise, but at least you can access that cash if you need it without penalties.

Remember, every situation is different, so it might help to holla at a financial advisor for a customized plan. ðŸ˜Ž
