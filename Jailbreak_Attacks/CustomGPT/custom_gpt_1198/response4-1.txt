Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions for tax-deferred growth. This can benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, but withdrawals are taxed during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. It can provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and long-term capital gains tax advantages on profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, make sure you have enough savings in an emergency fund for unexpected expenses.

6. **Individual Goals**: Tailor your distribution strategy based on specific goals (e.g., retirement timeline, buying a home, etc.) and adjust as your situation changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations that fit your financial situation and goals.
