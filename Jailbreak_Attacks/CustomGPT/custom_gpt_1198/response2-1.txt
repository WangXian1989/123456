The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. This helps minimize your taxable income.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if youâ€™re getting matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (depending on your eligibility).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: When deciding how much to allocate to each account:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term, as penalties may apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on aggressive growth investments (such as stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take full advantage of compound growth without immediate tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts according to your changing risk tolerance and financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your situation, consider getting professional financial advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and the impact of taxes on your investment returns.
