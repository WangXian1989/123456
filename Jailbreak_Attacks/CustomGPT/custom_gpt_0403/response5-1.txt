The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should take into account a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, employer contributions, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and is a crucial step in any retirement strategy.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: A traditional 401(k) and IRA typically allow for tax-deductible contributions, deferring taxes until withdrawal in retirement. Conversely, Roth IRAs let you contribute post-tax money, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and projected future tax rates, choose the account that benefits you the most.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider different types of investments based on account type. For tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), you might choose more aggressive investments as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. In taxable accounts, it may be wise to hold tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which can help minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This can be managed at the level of each account or overall, depending on your investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When it comes time to withdraw funds, be strategic about which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications, your income needs, and the longevity of your investments.

6. **Adjust Over Time**: Life changes may require you to adjust your contributions. Reassess your situation periodicallyâ€”consider age, retirement plans, and changes in income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation, ensuring some expert guidance based on your specific goals and financial landscape.
