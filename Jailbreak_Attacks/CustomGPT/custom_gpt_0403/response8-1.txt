When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider contributing to this first in the accumulation phase. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatments (like long-term capital gains). They are also useful for emergency funds or withdrawals before retirement age.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid cash in your taxable accounts or a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses as a safety net.

4. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**: Generally, allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in retirement accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, and use safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if you're concerned about short-term volatility.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your portfolio distribution and consider rebalancing if needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Consult Financial Advisors**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your unique situation and help you optimize tax implications.

Your exact distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, age, tax bracket, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
