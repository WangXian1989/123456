I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a healthcare professional for advice on liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific condition, but they often include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. In some cases, medications or procedures might be necessary depending on the severity and type of liver disease. Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best outcomes.
