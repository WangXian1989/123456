The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." Contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial for you. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate any funds left over after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, allocate funds to pay that down before investing.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and hold higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Changes**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Remember, the right distribution varies greatly from person to person, so individual factors play a significant role in determining the best approach for you.
