Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out your **Traditional or Roth IRA** contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or more flexible access to funds.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) should hold investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable accounts** should prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Pay attention to your present and future tax situations. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider Roth contributions to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

### 7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
