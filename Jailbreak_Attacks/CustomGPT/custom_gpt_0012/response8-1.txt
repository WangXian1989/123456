Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you have maxed out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments that generate little taxable income (like index funds) or for short-term savings, as capital gains are taxed when sold.
   - **IRAs and 401(k)s:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth options allow tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have at least 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid, easily accessible account before fully investing.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor the performance and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions and your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your specific goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

This approach maximizes growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
