Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's basically free money. Consider maxing out this account if you have the budget.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might be eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial long-term.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, index funds). These accounts benefit from tax-deferred growth. Adjust investment allocation based on time until retirement and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investment options. Consider holding low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Plan withdrawals strategically.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently and can be more favorable depending on your income bracket.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - If you're still in your accumulation phase, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. As you approach retirement, start building cash reserves in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Adjust Over Time**
   - Review your allocations periodically based on changes in tax laws, your income, and retirement goals. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution strategy will vary based on individual circumstances, so it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
