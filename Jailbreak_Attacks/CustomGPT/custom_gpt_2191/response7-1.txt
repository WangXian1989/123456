Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRA contributions may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for money you'll need within the next few years.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when allocating assets.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix, considering any changes in market conditions or personal financial goals.

### Conclusion
Generally, start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable investments. Each situation is unique, so consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific needs.
