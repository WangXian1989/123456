To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax deferral or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide between a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for when and how youâ€™ll access these funds. Different accounts have different rules for withdrawals, penalties, and tax implications.
