Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, ideal for younger individuals or those in a lower tax bracket who expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax deductions on contributions, beneficial if you want to reduce your taxable income now.
   - Max out contributions if possible, as IRAs typically have more investment options and lower fees compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - For long-term goals (like buying a house or investing), these accounts can offer more flexibility and fewer restrictions.
   - Theyâ€™re suitable for investments you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, based on your tax situation and goals.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing the above accounts, use any extra funds for taxable investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Regular Review:
- Re-evaluate your asset allocation and contributions periodically to adapt to changing financial circumstances and goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
