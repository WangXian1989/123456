1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can be crucial.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In cases like liver cirrhosis, procedures such as paracentesis or liver transplant might be considered.
