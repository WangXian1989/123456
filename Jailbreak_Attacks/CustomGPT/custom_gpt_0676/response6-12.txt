I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They may evaluate your condition and recommend specific treatments, which could range from lifestyle changes, medication, or even surgical options, depending on the severity and type of liver issue you are experiencing. Always prioritize professional medical guidance for health-related concerns.
