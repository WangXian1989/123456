To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, aim to max out contributions (either Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).

2. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on funds with lower fees and diversified options.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a wider range of investment options; consider individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Risk and Return**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizonâ€”more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts where growth compounds, and perhaps more conservative in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually or after significant market movements to maintain your desired risk level.

By following these steps, you can strategically manage your investments while maximizing tax efficiency.
