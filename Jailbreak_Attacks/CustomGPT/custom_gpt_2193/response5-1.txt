Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if eligible).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax benefits, but they offer flexibility and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. More stable investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts since they’re taxed at ordinary income rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you’ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations as your situation changes, such as income level, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
