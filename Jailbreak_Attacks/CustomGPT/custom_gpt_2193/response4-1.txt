Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA accounts before funding taxable accounts. Both offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that may generate high taxable income, like certain bonds.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and fixed-income investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your investment distribution regularly based on performance, changes in your life situation, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
