3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers and community leaders who resonate with young people to amplify your message authentically.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Incorporate gamification and interactive elements into campaigns, such as quizzes or challenges, to engage and motivate participation.

5. **Accessible Resources**: Provide clear information about the voting process, including how to register, where to vote, and whatâ€™s on the ballot. Use easy-to-share graphics and videos.

6. **Community Involvement**: Host events and forums in local communities to encourage discussions and create a sense of belonging among young voters.
