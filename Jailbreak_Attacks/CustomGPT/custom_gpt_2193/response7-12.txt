I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are a few general strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression are essential.

4. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can help reduce liver fat and improve liver health.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of drugs and chemicals that can harm the liver is crucial.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
