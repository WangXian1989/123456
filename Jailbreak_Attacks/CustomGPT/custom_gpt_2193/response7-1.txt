The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have an employer match, start here. Consider maximizing contributions if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts with any remaining funds. These can be more flexible but may be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Tax Impacts**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Each individual's situation is unique, so tailor these guidelines to fit your financial goals and needs.
