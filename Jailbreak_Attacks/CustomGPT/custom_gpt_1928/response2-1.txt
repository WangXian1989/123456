Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify (income limits apply), especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income. For retirement, focus on managing how and when you withdraw to minimize tax impact.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals. Use these accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate long-term capital gains (e.g., stocks) or are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Place higher tax-burden investments (like bonds or REITs) here, as you wonâ€™t be taxed until withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means spreading investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust according to market performance, changes in tax laws, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Final Thoughts
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation, especially for tax optimization and retirement planning.
