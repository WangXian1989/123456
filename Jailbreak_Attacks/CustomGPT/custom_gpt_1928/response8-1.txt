Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRAs**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) in each account type to balance risk. For example:
   - 401(k): Typically more growth-oriented investments.
   - IRA: A mix of growth and income investments.
   - Taxable accounts: Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Access Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age, a taxable account might be more suitable, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can incur penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to reflect changes in market conditions and your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor may help tailor your strategy more effectively to your situation.

Balancing these factors will help optimize your financial outcomes over time.
