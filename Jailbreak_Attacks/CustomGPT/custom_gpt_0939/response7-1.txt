Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Determine Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, and for IRAs, it is $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for individuals over 50).

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold. Consider utilizing these accounts for investments that generate little income (like index funds) to minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs) since those gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal. In taxable accounts, consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks, as they may be taxed at a higher rate.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively, regardless of the account type.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of investments (including employer match)
- **IRA:** 20% (a mix of Traditional and Roth depending on current tax status)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% (for liquidity and short-term needs)

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Given the complexity of personal finance, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.
