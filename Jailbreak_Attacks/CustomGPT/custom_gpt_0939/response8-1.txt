Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions if possible, as 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - Consider a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be used for short-term needs or after reaching contribution limits on retirement accounts.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and using strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Generally, it’s better to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities, consider talking to a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly review and adjust your distributions as needed, based on changes in income, taxes, and life circumstances.
