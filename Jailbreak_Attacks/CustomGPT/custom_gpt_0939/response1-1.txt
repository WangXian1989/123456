Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you can still contribute after your IRA, aim to maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This lowers your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've reached your limits on tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. These offer more liquidity and flexibility, but remember you’ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks (more stocks) in retirement accounts since they have time to recover from market fluctuations. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more stable investments (bonds, cash) in those accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
