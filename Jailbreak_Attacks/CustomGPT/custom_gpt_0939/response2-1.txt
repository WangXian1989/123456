Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket and expect to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - Keep in mind contribution limits for both accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional savings and flexibility. This is particularly useful for goals that are short- to medium-term, as you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your individual circumstances.

By strategically distributing your contributions and investments, you can optimize growth and manage taxes effectively over time.
