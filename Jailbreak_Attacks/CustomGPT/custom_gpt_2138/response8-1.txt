The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if you can—it has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider opening a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you are looking for immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA may be better as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains since they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. 
   - Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and place less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider discussing your situation with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

These strategies can help you maximize growth and minimize taxes over time.
