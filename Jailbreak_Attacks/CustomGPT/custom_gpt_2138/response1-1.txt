To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. 
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, and any income generated is also taxable. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Contribute to Matched 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider putting additional funds into your IRA if you can. For 2023, the maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). 
   - Depending on your income level, determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your financial situation.

4. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - If you plan to retire in 10 years or more, you may prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying your investments across all accounts to minimize risk. 

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Since 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed, consider drawing from taxable accounts first in the early years of retirement to reduce tax liabilities later.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and risk tolerance. 

8. **Consider Seeking Professional Help**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your financial goals, current income, and expected future circumstances. It’s essential to create a plan that accommodates your needs while optimizing tax advantages over time.
