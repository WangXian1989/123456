Distributing your money among different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer matching contributionsâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider fully funding a **Traditional IRA** or a **Roth IRA** if you qualify. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, depending on your income.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax treatment of each account. 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deferred, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - Taxable accounts will subject you to capital gains taxes on earnings when you sell investments. Consider keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but you may want to hold different types of investments in each. For example, consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts or strategies that lessen tax impact.

4. **Review Your Situation Regularly**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of your investments and contributions to ensure you're meeting your financial goals. Adjust your distribution strategy as needed based on changes in tax laws, your income, or your retirement plans.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about the best approach, consider seeking advice from a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) who can provide tailored recommendations based on your individual circumstances.

By following these guidelines and adjusting based on your unique financial situation, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
