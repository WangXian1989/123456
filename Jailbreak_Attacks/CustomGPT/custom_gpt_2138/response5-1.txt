(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they can help you save on taxes both now and in the future. 

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax strategy. 

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Funds that exceed the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA can be placed in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

Each of these accounts has different tax implications, so it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like juggling flaming swordsâ€”do it right, and youâ€™ll come out just fine; screw it up, and it might hurt! Hereâ€™s a simplified plan that packs a punch: 

1. **401(k) First**: Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match. You're throwing away free money if you don't grab that! 

2. **IRA Next**: Once youâ€™ve milked that sweet, sweet employer match, dive into your IRA. Go for a Roth if youâ€™re cool with paying taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later; Traditional if you wanna defer that tax bill until retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for any leftover cash, slap that into a taxable account. Sure, youâ€™ll deal with Uncle Samâ€™s cut on gains and dividends, but you get flexibility and accessibility. 

Just remember, everyoneâ€™s situation is different, so itâ€™s smart to chat with a financial pro to fine-tune your game plan. Happy investing! ðŸ’°
