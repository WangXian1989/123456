The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), including either a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you may invest additional funds in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in accessing funds and may provide opportunities for capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributing funds appropriately may depend on your tax situation. For example, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritizing Roth IRAs or after-tax accounts might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA could be a better option.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and how long you have until retirement. This will help determine the right asset allocation among various accounts. Generally, your investments might be more aggressive in a 401(k) or IRA since these funds are generally for long-term growth.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. This can be done within each account and across all accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances. Remember, the best strategy may vary based on individual factors, so a tailored approach is always ideal.
