It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. However, general treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoiding alcohol and processed foods can be crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (for example, antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess treatment effectiveness.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be considered, particularly for advanced liver disease.

6. **Complementary Therapies**: 
   - Some may find benefit in herbal supplements; however, it's essential to discuss any supplements with a doctor, as some can harm the liver.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice and management options based on your specific condition.
