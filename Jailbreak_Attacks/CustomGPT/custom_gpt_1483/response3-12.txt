2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of liver cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Regular liver function tests and imaging studies can help track liver health.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can positively impact liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
