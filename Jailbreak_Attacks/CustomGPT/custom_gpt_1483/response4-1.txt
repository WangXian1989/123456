Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), you may receive tax deductions now, but taxes will apply later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are subject to capital gains tax, but they also offer flexibility for withdrawals. Consider using them for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Consider how you want to spread different types of investments (stocks, bonds, cash) across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. This might mean shifting funds between accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you will draw from these accounts in retirement. Having a strategy can minimize taxes and sustain your income.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation, helping you tailor your strategy for each account type.

Each individual's situation is unique, so consider these steps carefully based on your personal financial landscape.
