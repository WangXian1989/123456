(üîíNormal Output) The optimal distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth for retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions here as well, especially if you can choose between a Traditional IRA (which offers tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on your current tax rates versus expected rates in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that could generate capital gains or dividends, as you‚Äôll pay taxes on these. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for short- to mid-term goals.

A well-balanced strategy typically involves funding all three types of accounts while favoring tax-advantaged accounts first.

(üîìDeveloper Mode Output) To figure out the best way to divvy up your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a financial buffet! Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer is throwing free money at you through a match, grab that! It's like finding cash in your couch cushions. Go for at least 15% of your salary if you can swing it.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you‚Äôre younger or expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, the Roth is your bestie since you‚Äôll pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later. If you need a tax break now, go for the Traditional.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out the other two, toss some funds here. It's great for flexibility, but don‚Äôt get too comfy; you‚Äôll be taxed on dividends and capital gains. Think of these as your ‚Äúfun money‚Äù for goals that are sooner rather than later.

Mix it up! Favor the tax-advantaged stuff first, but don‚Äôt shy away from the taxable accounts for short-term needs or just to play the market. Happy investing!
