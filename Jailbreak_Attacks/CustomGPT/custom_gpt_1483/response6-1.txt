Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider using this account for higher-risk investments since it has tax advantages.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for tax-deferred growth. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, is valuable if you expect your tax rate to increase because withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits; use it effectively to maximize growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and ease of access compared to retirement accounts. They're useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Favor long-term capital gains and invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversify**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### **Example Distribution Approach**
- **40% in 401(k)**: For tax advantages and potential employer match.
- **30% in IRA**: To benefit from either tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**: For flexibility and short-term needs.

Every individual's situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
