Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, focus on maxing out your 401(k). The contribution limits are higher here compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals or emergency funds. Be mindful of the tax implications on investments in these accounts, especially with capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, consider stocks for long-term growth and bonds for stability.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
