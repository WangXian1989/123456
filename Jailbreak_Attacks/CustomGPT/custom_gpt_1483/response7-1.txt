Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. Contribute to an IRA
Next, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income and eligibility, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The Roth can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. Fund Taxable Accounts
Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start funding a taxable investment account. This is useful for more flexible withdrawals and investments that do not fit into retirement accounts.

### 4. Consider Tax Implications
Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type:
- **401(k)/IRA:** Taxes are deferred until withdrawal (traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** You'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
Review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. Emergency Fund First
Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### Final Thought
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances. They can help refine your strategy and optimize your returns across different account types.
