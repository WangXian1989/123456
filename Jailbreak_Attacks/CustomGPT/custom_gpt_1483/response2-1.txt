Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out beneficial tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments here, like bonds or real estate, as they grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are either tax-efficient (like index funds) or generate qualified dividends for lower tax rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses, outside of these accounts for liquidity.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market performance.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your individual circumstances and help optimize your tax situation.
