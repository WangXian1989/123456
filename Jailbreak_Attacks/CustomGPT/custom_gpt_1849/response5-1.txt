Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you are currently in a higher tax bracket and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, focus on Traditional accounts for immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Fill Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks or ETFs that qualify for long-term capital gains rates. This helps minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Diversify Investments by Account:**
   - Allocate different types of investments based on the account type. For instance, consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess your investment balances and tax situation to adjust contributions accordingly. Life changes such as a new job or a raise may impact your strategy.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution strategy is personalized. It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that aligns with your overall financial goals.
