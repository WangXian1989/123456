Distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Choose the type that best aligns with your tax strategy (traditional for immediate tax benefits, Roth for tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments, but be aware of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Consider the types of investments in each account. For example:
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Ideal for holding bonds or higher-tax investments due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Better suited for stocks or investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your investment mix based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, consider working with a financial planner to optimize your investment strategy.

Each person's situation is unique, so it's important to evaluate your specific needs and goals when making these decisions.
