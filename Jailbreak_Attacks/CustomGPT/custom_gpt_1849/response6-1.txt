To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth, ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; choose between Roth (tax-free withdrawals) and Traditional (tax-deferred).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. Allocate Based on Goals:
   - **Retirement Priority**: Max out contributions to 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. Diversify Investments:
   - **401(k)**: Opt for low-cost index funds or target-date funds for growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, or ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., municipal bonds, ETFs).

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance:
   - Assess your allocation periodically to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. Tax Strategy:
   - Withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize taxable income, reserving taxable account withdrawals for last.

Following these strategies can help optimize your investment growth while balancing risk and accessibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
