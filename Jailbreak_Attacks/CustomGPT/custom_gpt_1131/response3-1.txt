The optimal strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions if possible ($22,500 per year as of 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual stock investments, or if you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading within taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across your accounts. For instance, it may make sense to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains more easily and less aggressive investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where they are less tax-efficient.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider the tax implications of each account type. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are not taxed at withdrawal.
   - Monitor your tax situation annually to adjust contributions appropriately.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

This strategic distribution can help you minimize tax liabilities while maximizing growth potential over time.
