Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and potential tax deductions based on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing withdrawals in retirement to be tax-free, which can be useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here incur capital gains tax when sold, so it may be beneficial for holding investments that generate qualifying dividends or long-term gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes in each account type to minimize risk.

5. **Time Horizon**: Allocate more to growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in accounts meant for long-term goals, while more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) might be appropriate for shorter time frames.

6. **Annual Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
