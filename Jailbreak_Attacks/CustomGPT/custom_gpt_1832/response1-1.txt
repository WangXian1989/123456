To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match—it's free money! Prioritize pre-tax contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax deferral. Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth. You'll pay taxes on contributions, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments you may need to access before retirement. They also offer more flexibility. Be mindful of tax implications on gains—tax-efficient funds or strategies can help minimize taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes and account types. This can optimize tax efficiency and improve overall returns.

5. **Goals & Time Horizon**: Align your distribution with your financial goals and timeline. Long-term investments can go into tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs may fit better in taxable.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your individual financial situation. They can help you navigate complex tax implications and asset allocation.

Make sure to reassess your allocations regularly as your financial situation and goals evolve.
