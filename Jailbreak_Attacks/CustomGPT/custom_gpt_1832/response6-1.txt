To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types & Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which reduces your taxable income. Ideal for maxing out employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contribution Levels**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA; the tax-free growth can be highly advantageous.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. 

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth**: A higher allocation to stocks within retirement accounts can be beneficial due to their tax-advantaged status.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, allocate more towards taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - Adjust contributions based on your current and anticipated future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts now.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly assess and adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions requires strategic planning based on personal financial goals, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Always aim to leverage tax advantages while ensuring you have access to funds when needed.
