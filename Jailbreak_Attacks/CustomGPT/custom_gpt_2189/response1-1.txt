Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages but provide flexibility. Consider keeping investments that have low turnover or qualify for long-term capital gains here.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement accounts, aim for growth-oriented investments since you won't need the money for years.
   - Taxable accounts can balance between growth and income-generating investments, depending on your needs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Align investments with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement (consider tax implications). Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from Roth accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
