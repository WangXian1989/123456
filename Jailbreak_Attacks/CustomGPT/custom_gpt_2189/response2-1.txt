Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for reducing taxable income if you're eligible for deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on this account.

### 4. **Balance Investments According to Goals**
   - Longer-term goals can take on more risk (e.g., stocks in your IRA), while shorter-term needs might require more conservative investments (e.g., bonds in your taxable accounts).

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalancing and Contribution Strategies**
   - Regularly review and adjust contributions based on performance and your changing financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to get the match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum amount allowed.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
