Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

### 2. Diversify Account Types
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may incur capital gains, leveraging the lower long-term capital gains tax rates. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) now. If you anticipate a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be advantageous.

### 4. Maintain Liquidity
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate liquid savings account for emergencies to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Summary Strategy
- **Prioritize 401(k)** contributions up to the match.
- **Fund IRA accounts** based on your eligibility and tax strategy.
- Allocate any surplus to **taxable accounts** for flexibility and additional investment growth.

Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to adapt to changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
