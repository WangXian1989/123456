Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, ideally reaching the annual limit if possible. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on whether you prefer tax savings now or in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that aren’t suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, or for savings goals within a 5- to 10-year timeline. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs that don’t generate much taxable income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, and alternatives) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your contributions based on changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
