Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Consider Fees**: Ensure the investment options in your 401(k) are low-cost and that you understand any fees associated.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Consider Traditional vs. Roth**: A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront, but withdrawals will be taxed. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute Early**: Start contributing to your IRA as soon as possible to take advantage of compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., holding onto investments for longer than one year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates).

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Your investment allocation should be based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize for tax efficiency.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's situation is different, so consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

Always review your allocations regularly and adjust as your financial situation changes.
