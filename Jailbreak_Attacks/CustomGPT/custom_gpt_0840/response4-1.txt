To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Assess which IRA suits your tax situationâ€”Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions.
   - Contribute to an IRA after reaching employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should generally be used for funds you might need access to before retirement. They can also be advantageous for investments with lower tax rates on capital gains.
   - Place investments that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce tax liabilities.

4. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Allocate funds according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks primarily for long-term growth, bonds for stability, etc.
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: As you age or your financial situation changes, periodically reassess and reallocate your investments. Younger investors might lean towards growth-oriented assets, while those nearing retirement may focus more on capital preservation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial goals and circumstances.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy to manage your investments across different types of accounts.
