When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. This allows for tax-deferred growth, reducing your taxable income now.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a taxable account for easy access.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income or for short-term goals to avoid unfavorable tax implications.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA for investments expected to grow significantly, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals.

8. **Long-Term Goals**: Factor in your retirement timeline and financial goals when deciding how much to allocate to each account.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your personal situation.
