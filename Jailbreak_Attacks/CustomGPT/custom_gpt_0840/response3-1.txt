When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a holistic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some steps to help you strategize:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments without tax advantages; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Best for short-term goals or investments that might be needed before retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds, as this is essentially "free money".
   - Next, contribute to an IRA if you qualify to maximize tax benefits. Choose between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

3. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, you might place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRA), while using a more conservative approach in taxable accounts where you might need liquidity.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments (that may generate capital gains) in your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA). 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or are held long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will access each account, especially in retirement. Understanding the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account can help optimize your savings.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Financial situations change, as do tax laws and investment performance. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your specific circumstances.
