To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the match, then consider tax efficiency.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax burdens.
   - Consider holding cash or short-term bonds in these accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting contributions as needed based on performance.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient investment approach that leverages the tax benefits of each account type.
