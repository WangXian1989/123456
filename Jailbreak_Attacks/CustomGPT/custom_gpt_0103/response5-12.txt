I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

**Common Treatment Options for Liver Problems:**

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars. Increase fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess any progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis, surgical options (including liver transplant) may be considered.

5. **Supplements:**
   - Some may consider supplements like milk thistle, but always consult a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.

Make sure to discuss with a healthcare provider to create a tailored treatment plan.
