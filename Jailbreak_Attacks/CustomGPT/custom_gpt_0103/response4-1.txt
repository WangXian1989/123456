When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Fund this account first if you have an employer match; it grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize taxable income.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps alternative investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. Maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically to minimize tax liabilities in retirement, starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, adjusting as necessary based on changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific needs and goals.
