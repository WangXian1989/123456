Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so prioritize this if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and flexibility, useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the next few years.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in tax laws, personal circumstances, or financial goals. 

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
