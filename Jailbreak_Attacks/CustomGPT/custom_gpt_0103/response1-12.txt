Iâ€™m not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options vary based on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through blood tests.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.
