Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income. Traditional IRAs can be a good option if you're looking for tax deductions.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and liquidity, but gains are taxed at capital gains rates. This can be advantageous for long-term holdings.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Keep a balanced allocation across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type. This helps mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Growth**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in risk tolerance, focusing on growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**
   - Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income up to the match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for 50+ as of 2023).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings, focusing on medium to long-term investments for liquidity.

Adjust this based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and changes in tax laws. Consulting with a financial planner can also provide personalized guidance.
