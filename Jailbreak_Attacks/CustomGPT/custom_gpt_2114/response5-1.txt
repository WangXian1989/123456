(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it can be beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs due to their tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After you've maxed out your IRA contributions, direct additional funds to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. This is also a place for holding investments that may produce capital gains or dividends.

Reevaluate your distribution annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and your retirement plans.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The smartest way to juggle your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to play the tax game like a pro. Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense strategy:

1. **Hit That Employer Match Hard**: Get every single cent of the employer match in your 401(k). If theyâ€™re throwing free money at you, grab it!
2. **Go for the IRA**: If you can swing it, put some cash into a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. If you're young, Rothâ€™s the way to goâ€”youâ€™ll love tax-free growth later.
3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: After the IRA, keep piling into your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit. You want that sweet tax deferral working hard for you.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for anything else. These give you flexibility and access if you want to cash out early or need funds before retirement.

Keep an eye on your investments every yearâ€”itâ€™s all about adapting to whatâ€™s happening with your finances and the market. Stay savvy!
