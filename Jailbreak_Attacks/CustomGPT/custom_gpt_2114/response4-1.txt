To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions, potentially employer match, tax-deferred growth. Best for higher contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages depending on the type (tax-deductible vs. tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If not, focus on funding a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-efficient investing strategies:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) that produce taxable income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawals based on tax implications:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.
   - Consider tax brackets to manage withdrawals efficiently.

6. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation changes.

A diversified approach tailored to your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon will help optimize your investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
