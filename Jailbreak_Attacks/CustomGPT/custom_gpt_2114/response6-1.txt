Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: Fund your IRA next, focusing on either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last**

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA. Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize tax impacts from capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**

- **Income Level**: If you're in a higher income bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income. If expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth contributions.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**

- **Growth vs. Income**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, growth-oriented investments go into tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments can be placed in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### Summary

- **Prioritize tax advantages**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Consider tax efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles in your taxable account.
- **Review and adjust**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, goals, and tax laws.
