Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on them until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider allocating funds here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Accessibility**
   - **401(k)**: Generally for retirement; invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k) but with potentially more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in more liquid assets that you might need access to in the short term. Consider using ETFs or index funds for tax efficiency.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diverse mix across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider different sectors or asset classes.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor your investment allocation periodically. Adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, or life events.

### Conclusion
A tailored approach that considers the above factors will help optimize your distribution strategy. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to align investments with your specific situation.
