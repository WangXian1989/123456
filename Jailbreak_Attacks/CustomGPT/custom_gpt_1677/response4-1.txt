Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations.

2. **Consider your tax bracket**: 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize contributions to traditional accounts for the tax deduction.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, you might benefit from a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Create an emergency fund**: 
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid, safe account.

4. **Assess your investment goals**: 
   - For long-term growth, a higher percentage can go into tax-advantaged accounts since gains are either tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains for more favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversify your investments**: 
   - Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review regularly**: 
   - Rebalance your allocations at least annually to adjust for market changes and shifts in your financial goals.

Ultimately, it's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation.
