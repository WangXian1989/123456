Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but can incur capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that you plan to hold short-term or for high yield investments that produce dividends or interest income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. This can help mitigate risks.

4. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations as market conditions change and as you approach retirement.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in accounts like the 401(k) or IRA, whereas those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice would be beneficial.
