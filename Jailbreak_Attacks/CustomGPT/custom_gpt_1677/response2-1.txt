Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax preferences.
   - The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now.

### 3. **Max Out Your 401(k) Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 if you're over 50). This provides high contribution limits and tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity. This is beneficial if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that you diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Review Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts may have tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains, so consider placing low-turnover investments like index funds in these accounts.

### 7. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to reflect changing market conditions and your financial goals.

### Example Scenario:
1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to your IRA next, targeting tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use any additional funds for short-term goals or further growth opportunities.

### Summary
Tailor your strategy based on individual factors like age, income, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
