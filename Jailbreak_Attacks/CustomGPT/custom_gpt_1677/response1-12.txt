I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietician to ensure a balanced diet that supports liver health.
5. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.
