To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, so consider holding investments at least a year to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Spread across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations yearly to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before fully investing in these accounts.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your financial growth while taking advantage of tax benefits.
