Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - Contribution limits: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - Investment options: Assess the investment choices available in your 401(k) and opt for low-cost funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Traditional IRA: Good for tax deductions if you qualify. Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Contribution limits: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without withdrawal penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - Tax considerations: Be mindful of capital gains tax on investments; holding for over a year can reduce tax rates.
   - Use for short-term goals: Consider taxable accounts for funds needed within the next 5-10 years.

### General Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to get the full employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
2. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of assets across accounts to balance growth and risk.
3. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations at least annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution varies by individual circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific needs.
