Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions; grows tax-deferred; typically has employer matches.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions next, particularly if considering a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: Invest in taxable accounts once you’ve maxed contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, focus on tax-deferred accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts.
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as this can affect your tax situation.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If retirement is decades away, utilize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.
   - Adjust the allocation as you near retirement, shifting to more conservative investments.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio to spread risk and maximize returns.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
- **Step 1**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Step 2**: Max out your IRA contributions.
- **Step 3**: Allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
