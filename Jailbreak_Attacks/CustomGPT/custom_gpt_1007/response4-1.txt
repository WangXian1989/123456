Distributing your money among 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you’re able. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments outside of retirement accounts, especially if you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments to balance risk. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be spread across all types of accounts.
   - Be mindful of asset location: high-growth investments may be better in tax-deferred accounts, while tax-efficient investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Keep an Eye on Taxes**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account.
   - Plan for your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs after age 73.

If you have specific goals or circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can tailor advice to your needs.
