Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA & 401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals will be taxed later at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. This account is best for short-term goals or if you need flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Goals:** Utilize taxable accounts for savings that you may need sooner (e.g., buying a home).
   - **Long-term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Different accounts might require different asset allocations based on their tax implications. For example:
     - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
     - Hold more income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts because of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before making aggressive moves with investments.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Roth IRA:** Max out your contributions here if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate additional savings here for flexibility or short-term goals.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Your financial situation may change, so it's wise to review and adjust your allocations annually or after major life events.

### Seek Professional Guidance
If youâ€™re unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By balancing these considerations, you'll be better positioned to optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
