Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as they offer tax advantages.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if you can. The limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of investments available in your 401(k) to balance risk and growth.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), based on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Max Contributions**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for assets you may need to access before retirement without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider tax implications when deciding what investments to hold in each account. For instance, hold higher-growth assets (which might generate higher capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping lower-growth investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a plan for when and how to withdraw from each account during retirement, as this can significantly impact your tax situation.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, tailoring your contributions to your specific financial situation and retirement goals is key. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your circumstances change. Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that suits your needs.
