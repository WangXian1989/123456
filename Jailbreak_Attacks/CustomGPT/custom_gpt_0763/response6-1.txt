Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - **Consider Roth IRA:** If your income allows, a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid assets.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds:** Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance, with a greater focus on stocks for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Monitor capital gains in taxable accounts and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

These principles will help you optimize your investment strategy and align it with your financial goals.
