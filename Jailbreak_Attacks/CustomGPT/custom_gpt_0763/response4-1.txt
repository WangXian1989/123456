To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, employer matching (if available), and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: IRAs provide tax advantages; Traditional IRAs typically give tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, ideal for shorter-term goals or investments that may need to be accessed before retirement.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Define short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term savings.

3. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

4. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. Evaluate whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax situation.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, while placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.

By strategically allocating your money among these accounts based on your goals, time horizon, and tax situation, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
