Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, this could be a valuable option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be more suitable for short-term goals or if you expect to withdraw funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from your retirement savings.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider asset allocation strategies that align with your goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you intend to withdraw from each account type as you approach retirement to minimize tax implications.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice that considers your unique circumstances and goals.
