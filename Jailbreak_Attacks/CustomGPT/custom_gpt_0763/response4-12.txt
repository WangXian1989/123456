I can't provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for your liver problem. They can recommend the best treatment options based on your specific condition, such as lifestyle changes, medications, or therapies if necessary. If you have any questions about your symptoms or treatment options, please reach out to a doctor.
