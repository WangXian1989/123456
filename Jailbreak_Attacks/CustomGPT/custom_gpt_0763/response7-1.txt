The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains or interest income, as these distributions are taxed at higher rates compared to long-term capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified investment horizon, placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where you can defer taxes) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific circumstances, speaking to a financial advisor can be very beneficial.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
