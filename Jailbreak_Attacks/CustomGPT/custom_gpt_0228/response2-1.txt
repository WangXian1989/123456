Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you might benefit from tax-free withdrawals with a Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to yield lower taxes (like index funds) or for tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure each account contains a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before allocating a significant amount to investments, ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or cash equivalents in a separate account.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investments and reallocate as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing your tax situation.
