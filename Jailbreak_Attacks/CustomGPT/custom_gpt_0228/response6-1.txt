To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals), based on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate tax-efficient income, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes in each account type, considering the tax implications of capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Implementation Tips:
- **Maximize Contributions:** Aim for the annual contribution limits in 401(k) and IRA.
- **Optimize for Taxes:** Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals while minimizing tax liability.
