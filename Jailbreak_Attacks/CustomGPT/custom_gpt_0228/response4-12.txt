I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatments typically depend on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, weight loss, and increased exercise can be crucial.
2. **Medication**: Depending on the liver issue, medications might manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Procedures**: In cases of severe liver damage, interventions like endoscopy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.
