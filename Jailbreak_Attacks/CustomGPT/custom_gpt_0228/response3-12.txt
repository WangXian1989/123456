I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs (for hepatitis) or corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health, especially if you have liver disease.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treating conditions like diabetes or obesity can help alleviate liver issues.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
