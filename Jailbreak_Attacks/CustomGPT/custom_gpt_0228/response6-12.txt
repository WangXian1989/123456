I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis infections.
   - **Medications for Liver Disease**: As prescribed based on specific conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Check-Ups**: Regular tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - **Substance Avoidance**: Limit or eliminate alcohol and avoid harmful substances.

5. **Weight Management**:
   - **Weight Loss**: If overweight, losing weight can help reduce fatty liver disease.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
