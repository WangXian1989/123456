To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Taxation**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), helping reduce your taxable income now or allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable accounts** are subject to capital gains tax on earnings and interest.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match accounts to short-term and long-term goals. Use 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings and taxable accounts for more flexible access.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), up to the annual limit, as it offers tax advantages.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Consider the types of investments suitable for each account, particularly if you want to take on more risk in taxable accounts for higher flexibility.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed more favorably due to lower capital gains rates.

### Suggested Steps:
1. **Fund your 401(k)** to at least the employer match.
2. **Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA** depending on your tax situation.
3. **Invest remaining funds in your taxable account** for liquidity and flexibility.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific goals and financial circumstances.
