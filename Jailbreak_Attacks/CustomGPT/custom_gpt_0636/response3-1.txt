Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing up to the annual limit, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, although you’ll need to pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk, considering your overall asset allocation strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses, to avoid dipping into retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice reflecting your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy optimizes your savings while considering tax implications and your financial goals.
