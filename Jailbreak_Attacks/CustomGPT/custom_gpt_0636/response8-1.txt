When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Use these for long-term growth and if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for investments you might want to access before retirement. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, so be mindful of the investment's tax efficiency (e.g., investing in index funds).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have cash reserves for emergencies to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your individual financial situation and goals.
