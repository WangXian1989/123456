To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions), depending on your tax situation. 

2. **Assess your investment goals and timeline**:
   - **Long-term growth**: If you have a long horizon, allocate more to equities within these tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep more liquid assets in your taxable account for easy access without penalties.

3. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower taxes (like ETFs or municipal bonds) or prefer long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax-deferred accounts**: Hold higher-growth assets that may generate taxable income in the future.

4. **Regularly review and rebalance**:
   - Adjust allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions to maintain your desired risk level and financial objectives.

By strategically funding your accounts based on these principles, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.
