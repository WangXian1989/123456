Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 for catch-up).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, using a Traditional 401(k) or Traditional IRA can offer immediate tax benefits. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Roth account might be more advantageous.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Inside each type of account, maintain a diversified investment portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets accordingly.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your planned withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free for longer.

6. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a more effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
