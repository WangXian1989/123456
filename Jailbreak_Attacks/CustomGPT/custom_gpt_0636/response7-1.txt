Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity and unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - **Younger Individuals**: Might lean towards growth-oriented investments (more stocks) in retirement accounts due to longer time horizons.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Gradually shift to more conservative investments (bonds) to preserve capital.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you navigate complex tax situations and tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to get the employer match, then contribute as much as you can afford, ideally up to the IRS limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that donâ€™t fit well into tax-advantaged accounts or to tap into funds without penalties.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary by individual, so adjusting based on personal circumstances and ongoing financial goals is essential.
