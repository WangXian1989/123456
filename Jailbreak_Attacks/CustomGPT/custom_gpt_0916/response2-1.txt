When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to understand the pros and cons of each type of account as well as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a fantastic return on investment.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before investing significantly in any account, pay down high-interest debt (like credit cards) to avoid paying more in interest than you would earn from investments.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions). The contribution limits are lower than for a 401(k), but it offers greater investment choices.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After getting the employer match and contributing to an IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit). The tax-deferred growth can be very advantageous.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you've maxed out your retirement accounts, a taxable brokerage account is a good option for additional investments. You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits, but you have the flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix. This ensures you stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary (to get the maximum match).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum annual amount allowed.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
