To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which maximizes your investment potential.
   - **Consider Roth Accounts**: If in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA may be beneficial, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Account Type Characteristics**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment choices than many 401(k) plans. It can be a great place for long-term investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how long you have until retirement. For a long timeline, more aggressive investments may be appropriate.
   - **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced approach across all accounts. For instance, hold bonds in your taxable account to avoid high taxes on dividends and interest.

### Recommendations:
- **Contribute 15% of income to 401(k), max out IRA contributions ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for over 50)**
- **Consider maintaining a cash reserve in a taxable account for liquidity while focusing long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.**

Evaluate your financial situation regularly to make modifications based on life changes or market conditions.
