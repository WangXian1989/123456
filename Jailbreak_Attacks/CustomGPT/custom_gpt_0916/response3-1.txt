Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet the employer match, then consider adding more if you can. The contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may benefit from either a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxable withdrawals). Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investing. This approach is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. 

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks and bonds can be allocated differently depending on whether you're primarily focused on growth or preservation of capital.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your current financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your unique financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of your total investments (enough to get the full match)
- **IRA**: 10% of your total investments (maxing out if possible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: The remaining balance, adjusted for your goals and needs.

Always consider your long-term goals when making these decisions, as well as current tax implications.
