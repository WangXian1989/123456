(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before turning to taxable accounts. This helps you reduce taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your investment strategy based on your timelines. Riskier investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while safer ones can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Withdrawals and Timing**: Plan your withdrawals according to the tax implications. Taxable accounts generally allow more flexibility without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA accounts have specific withdrawal rules.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also wise to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.

1. **Snag That Match**: First off, if your job throws in a 401(k) match, max that out, it's like free cash. Donâ€™t leave that on the table!

2. **Prioritize Tax Shields**: Next, dump as much as you can into your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts are all about that tax deferral game or Roth-style tax-free growth. Go wild here; itâ€™s a long play!

3. **Mix it Up**: For your taxable accounts, keep it chill. Thatâ€™s where you want to put investments that wonâ€™t rack up huge capital gains. Think dividends and lower-growth stuff.

4. **Withdrawal Game**: Plan how youâ€™re pulling out your cash later on. Keep in mind that taxable accounts are your playground when you need cash quick without penalty.
