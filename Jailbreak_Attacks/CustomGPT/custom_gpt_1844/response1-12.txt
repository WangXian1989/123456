I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. Here are some possibilities:

1. **Medication**: Depending on your diagnosis, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and manage any potential complications.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical procedures may be needed, such as for tumors or severe damage.

5. **Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
