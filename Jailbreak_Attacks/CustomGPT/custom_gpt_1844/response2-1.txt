Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains, so consider this when choosing investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds generating interest) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Stocks, which are generally more tax-efficient due to long-term capital gains rates, can be held in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary (up to the maximum allowed)
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds or what’s left after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your specific circumstances, including your income, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.
