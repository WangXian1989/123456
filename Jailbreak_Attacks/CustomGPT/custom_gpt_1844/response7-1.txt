Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, the maximum contribution for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current income level and expected retirement income. If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. If you expect your tax rate to rise, focus on Roth accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider stocks for long-term growth and bonds for stability.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. This ensures that you do not inadvertently take on more risk than intended.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your financial situation and investment strategy. Life events, changes in income, or shifts in market conditions may necessitate adjustments.
