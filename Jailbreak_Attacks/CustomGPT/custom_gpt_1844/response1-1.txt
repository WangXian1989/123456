Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) since they offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA, in particular, allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any money above and beyond your retirement accounts can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but can incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains taxes, but long-term holdings are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund to avoid dipping into these accounts for unexpected expenses.

7. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these steps to your specific situation.
