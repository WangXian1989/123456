To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as it lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free growth.
   - Utilize traditional accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals at that time.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers limited investment options. Choose funds that align with your long-term goals.
   - **IRA**: Provides more flexibility. You can select a diverse range of investments such as stocks, bonds, or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

6. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Tailor your contributions based on how close you are to retirement; younger investors may focus more on growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prioritize preservation of capital.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
