To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax (or Roth after-tax).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) benefit from growth without immediate tax consequences. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth assets (like stocks) may be better in tax-deferred accounts, while income-producing assets (like bonds) might be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your portfolio allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your investment strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

By integrating these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your funds across your accounts.
