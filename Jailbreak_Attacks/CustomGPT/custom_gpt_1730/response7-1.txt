Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider contributing here first to reach the maximum limit, especially if you have a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This can be more flexible for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth. 
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so review your strategy regularly to ensure it still aligns with your objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Getting personalized advice can optimize your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
