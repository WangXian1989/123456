1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help manage weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.
   - **Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs:** May be prescribed for conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and determine the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be the option if the liver is significantly damaged.
