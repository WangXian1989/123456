To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Choose based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)). For current tax savings, traditional accounts might be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that you may need access to before retirement. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on bond interest or short-term gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts, to manage your tax burden effectively.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice to tailor your investment strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions and considering the tax implications of each account, you'll better position yourself for financial growth and security.
