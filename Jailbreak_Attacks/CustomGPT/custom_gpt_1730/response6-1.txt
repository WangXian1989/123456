To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to reach the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. Aim to max out contributions if you can.

### 2. **Allocate Investments Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on holding investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in these accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for growth-oriented investments, while keeping a balanced and conservative approach in taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Asset Location**: Place highly taxed assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, taking into account performance and tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
