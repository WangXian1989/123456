Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: If you can afford to save more, continue contributing to your 401(k), aiming to reach the annual limit ($22,500 for those under 50 in 2023, $30,000 for those 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, put additional savings into a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on the account type. Consider more aggressive assets like stocks in taxable accounts, where you may be subject to capital gains taxes upon selling, and balance this with more conservative options in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income from 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity before tying up all funds in retirement accounts — having an emergency fund is essential.

8. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocation based on major life changes, market conditions, and shifts in financial goals.

Ultimately, balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and retirement readiness. It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
