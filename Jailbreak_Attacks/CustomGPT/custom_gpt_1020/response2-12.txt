I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a doctor or a liver specialist to discuss your specific liver problem. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications. In some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplant may be necessary. Please seek professional medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
