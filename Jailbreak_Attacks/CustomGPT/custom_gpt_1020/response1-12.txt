I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest some general options that are commonly recommended for liver health issues. Treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help manage liver problems.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat inflammation, infection, or other underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and overall health.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, such as certain medications or chemicals.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative treatments, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider for safety.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
