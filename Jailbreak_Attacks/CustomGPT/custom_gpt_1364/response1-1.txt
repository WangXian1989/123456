Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking at a traditional IRA, remember you may get a tax deduction for contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate. This is also a good place for investments that you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Generally, you can afford to take more risks in these accounts since they are long-term investments. Consider a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: It might be wise to hold bonds or REITs here if they generate income, as these may be taxed more heavily.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance them annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor may be beneficial.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and consult a professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
