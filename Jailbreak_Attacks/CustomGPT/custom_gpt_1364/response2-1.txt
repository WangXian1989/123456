To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Evaluate Contributions Based on Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan, especially if they offer a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and helps you take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket and anticipated retirement income.

2. **Balance Between Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Aim to have a mix of both traditional (401(k) and traditional IRA) and Roth (Roth IRA) accounts. This can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - For your 401(k) and IRA accounts, focus on long-term goals with a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Municipal bonds can also provide tax-free interest.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep sufficient cash in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals, so you're not forced to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Annual Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts. This helps maintain your desired risk level and potentially improves returns over time.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Remember that every individual's financial situation is unique, so your optimal distribution may vary based on your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.
