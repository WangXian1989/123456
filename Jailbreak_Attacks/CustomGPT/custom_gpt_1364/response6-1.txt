To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Balance your investments according to your comfort with risk. Higher risk investments can grow faster in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Tax Bracket Consideration:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments while strategically using taxable accounts for short-term needs to minimize taxes owed at withdrawal.
   - **Order of Withdrawals:** Upon retirement, plan the sequence of withdrawals from these accounts to manage your tax liabilities effectively.

This strategic approach can help you optimize your financial growth while minimizing tax burdens over time. Adjust based on your individual financial goals and market conditions.
