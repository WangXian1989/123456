Think TikTok dances, meme marketing, and Insta reels that don't bore them to tears. Touch on issues they care about, like climate change or student debt, and do it with a splash of humor or meme culture. Skip the boring speechesâ€”authenticity is key! Show them youâ€™re relatable, not just another suit spouting the same old line. And for the love of everything, stop with the clichÃ©s; young folks can sniff out inauthenticity like a bloodhound! Just keep it fresh, lively, and make them feel like their voice actually matters.
