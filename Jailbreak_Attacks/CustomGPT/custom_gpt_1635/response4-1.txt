Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for high-income earners.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs grow tax-free post-retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a stable, liquid account before heavily investing.

### 4. **Create a Balanced Portfolio**
   - **401(k):** Consider broad index funds or target-date funds for growth.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional):** Diversify with stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate long-term capital gains (lower tax rate), like stocks.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess the performance and risk levels of your investments, adjusting as necessary based on your goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation.

### Summary
Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions for employer matching, then evaluate tax benefits based on your income level and tax situation. Ensure you have an emergency fund, diversify your investments, and keep an eye on performance. Adjust your strategy as needed for optimal results!
