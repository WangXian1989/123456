Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Know Your Accounts**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). 
- **Taxable Accounts**: These can be invested in stocks, bonds, or funds, but gains are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA next, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for additional investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**

- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), which allow your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: These are beneficial for short-term needs or if you need access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**

- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, a mix of stocks and bonds based on age and retirement target.
- **Place Investments Strategically**:
  - **Tax-inefficient Investments (e.g., bonds, REITs)**: Consider these in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest and dividends.
  - **Tax-efficient Investments (e.g., stocks)**: Better suited for taxable accounts, especially if you hold them long-term for lower capital gains rates.

### 5. **Review Regularly**

- **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess your allocation and contributions as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.
- **Adjust for Market Conditions**: Be prepared to rebalance based on market performance and your evolving risk tolerance.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your short-term and long-term financial goals, optimizing for tax benefits while ensuring you have sufficient liquidity. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
