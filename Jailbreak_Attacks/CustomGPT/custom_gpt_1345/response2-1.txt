Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match limit for tax benefits. If you can, max out contributions after that.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These may be useful for short-term goals or if you're already maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio by distributing investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations to align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

Always keep your long-term financial goals in mind when making these decisions!
