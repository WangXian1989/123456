Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contribution:**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
     - Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA Contributions:**
     - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.
     - Maximize your contributions to utilize tax benefits.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for assets you'll need for short-term goals (like buying a home) or for when you want more access to funds.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Determine your risk tolerance and age. Typically, younger individuals can afford more risk.
     - Consider equities in tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and the benefit of tax-free growth.
     - Use bonds in taxable accounts to manage interest income tax.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
- Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then invest in taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and tax considerations. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategy is often beneficial.

Make sure to evaluate your specific circumstances and adjust these strategies as needed!
