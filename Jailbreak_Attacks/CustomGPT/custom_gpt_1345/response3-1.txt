Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, consider paying off any high-interest debt as this can sometimes provide better returns than investing.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) match. IRAs often have a wider range of investment options.

4. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing. This is particularly valuable if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions can lower your taxable income.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider a taxable investment account. This provides more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Aim for a balance of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation in retirement.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Revisit your allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific circumstances or need tailored advice, working with a financial advisor can help optimize your strategy.

This balanced approach will help you build a diversified portfolio that can adapt to your changing financial needs and goals.
