Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money!
   - **Investment Choices**: Look into your investment options and fees. Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate vs. expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual contribution limits and prioritize these if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, but you’ll owe taxes on gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxes.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Diversity**: Diversify your investments between these accounts based on when you’ll need the funds.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Final Tip:
Consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy and account for your unique circumstances. They can provide insights tailored to your financial situation.
