To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax deductions on contributions. These are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re younger, you might choose to invest more aggressively in your taxable accounts, while prioritizing tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance, and rebalance as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
