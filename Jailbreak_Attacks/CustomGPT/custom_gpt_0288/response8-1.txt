The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket as contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This can be useful for funds you might need before retirement, as it offers more flexibility.

4. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income (like index funds) and keep higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your accounts and financial goals to adjust your contributions as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
