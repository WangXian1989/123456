Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your tax rate is high.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Choose based on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and to invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across your accounts to balance risk and return:
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Put higher-yield, less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Investment Timeline**: Align account contributions with your goals:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Long-term growth should focus on retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
