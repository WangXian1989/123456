To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if your income allows it. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prefer investments subject to lower capital gains tax, such as index funds and ETFs.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and retirement timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for when to withdraw from each account type, considering tax implications. Typically, tax-deferred accounts should be drawn from last.

6. **Review Annually**: Reassess your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
