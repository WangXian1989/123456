The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general principles to consider when allocating your investments:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs provide tax advantages. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be a better choice if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, while tax-advantaged accounts offer deferment or elimination of these taxes. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). You can have a mix of growth and income-producing investments to balance risk and returns.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are many years away from retirement, you might want to take on more risk with a higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) or IRA. As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired level of risk.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place with enough cash to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before aggressively funding your investment accounts.

Each individual’s situation may vary, so consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
