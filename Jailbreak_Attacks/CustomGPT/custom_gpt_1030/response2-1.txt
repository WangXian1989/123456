The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Evaluate your current tax situation to decide which is better for you.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Different accounts can hold different asset allocations based on your age and risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burden. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how long you plan to let the investments grow. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free if conditions are met.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure that your strategy aligns with your financial goals and market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, so it's important to tailor these strategies to fit your own financial goals and needs.
