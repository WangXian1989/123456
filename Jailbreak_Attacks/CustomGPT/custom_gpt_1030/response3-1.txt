Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations and steps to help you decide on the best distribution strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan often with tax advantages and potential matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement account that also offers tax advantages. There are traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth IRAs (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have the tax advantages of retirement accounts. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Identify short-term vs. long-term goals. Retirement savings typically benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment preferences (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.).

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If available, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax benefits that can help your investments grow.

4. **Evaluate Contributions**:
   - For a 401(k), check the contribution limits (as of 2023, it’s $22,500, with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50).
   - For an IRA, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Consider which type of IRA is best for you based on your current and expected future tax bracket.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications on investment income in taxable accounts; consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and asset allocation at least annually or when significant life changes occur (like a job change, marital status, etc.).
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation and future goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while maximizing growth potential and tax efficiency.
