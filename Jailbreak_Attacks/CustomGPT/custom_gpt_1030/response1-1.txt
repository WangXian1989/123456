Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Max out your employer's match first, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing the maximum limit if you have a high-income, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal. Ideal for those who anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA to benefit from compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for strategies such as tax-loss harvesting.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax when you sell investments in these accounts.
   - Consider holding lower-turnover investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with employer match contributions in your 401(k).
- Then, contribute to an IRA (considering the benefits of each type based on your tax situation).
- Finally, redirect any additional savings into taxable accounts as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
