Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you:

### 1. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals:** If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) because they offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Funds needed in the next few years may be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 3. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they’re realized.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, but consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting**
   - In taxable accounts, you can sell investments at a loss to offset gains and reduce your taxable income.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to at least get the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA up to the maximum limit.
3. Any additional savings can then go into taxable accounts, focusing on investments that minimize tax impact.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances. This will help you make informed decisions that align with your long-term financial objectives.
