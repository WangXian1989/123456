Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is generally $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Savings**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account for liquidity.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, these should focus on long-term growth since you won’t access these funds until retirement. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and index funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should contain investments that you might need quicker access to, and consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Withdrawals from taxable accounts are generally taxed at capital gains rates, whereas 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals based on your tax bracket in retirement.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary.

### 7. **Consult a Professional**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and investment options, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This framework should help you formulate a balanced approach considering both growth potential and tax implications.
