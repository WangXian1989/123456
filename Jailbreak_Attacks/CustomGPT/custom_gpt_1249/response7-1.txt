Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some strategies to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Account Features**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, pre-tax contributions (traditional) or after-tax contributions (Roth). Good for long-term growth, but usually limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional or Roth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for withdrawals, but earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to the annual limit.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting extra savings into taxable accounts for quicker access.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of account types (tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable) to give you flexibility in retirement.
   - **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place investments that generate high returns or are subject to higher taxes (e.g., REITs, high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Review Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as necessary.

### 5. **Keep an Eye on Fees**
   - **Low-Cost Investments**: Look for low-fee mutual funds or ETFs to minimize costs. 

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match first, then to full limit.
2. **IRA**: Full contribution limit for Roth or traditional based on eligibility.
3. **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings beyond tax-advantaged limits.
