Distributing your money among retirement accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
     - Consider maximizing contributions if you can, as they're pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
     - Contribute to an IRA to further benefit from tax advantages.
     - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be better.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider low-turnover investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance (stocks vs. bonds).
   - **Time Horizon**: If retirement is far off, consider more aggressive investments.

### 4. **Regular Review**
   - Rebalance your allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market fluctuations.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have savings set aside for emergency expenses outside of these accounts.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your financial growth while considering tax implications.
