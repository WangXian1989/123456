Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high employer match, prioritize contributing up to that limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), consider maxing out contributions here next, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but capital gains taxes will apply when you sell investments.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If investing for long-term goals (like retirement), favor tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) for growth.
   - For shorter-term needs, tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts may be better.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a well-diversified portfolio to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This approach can help optimize your investment growth while managing taxes and ensuring liquidity when needed.
