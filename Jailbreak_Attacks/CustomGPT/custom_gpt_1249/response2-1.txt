Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions upfront, depending on your income.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider your current vs. future tax rates.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, which may have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax liability.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your investment choices across accounts are diversified (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and potential returns. 

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement; strategizing which accounts to draw from first can help minimize taxes.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out to the employer match; then contribute up to the annual limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount based on your eligibility (Roth vs. Traditional).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth vehicles.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement needs.
