To maximize your investments and tax efficiency, consider these guidelines for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing any employer match, aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your growth.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or income (like bonds or REITs) which may be taxed at a higher rate. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Ideal for bonds and other income-generating assets since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Great for high-growth assets since no taxes are paid on withdrawals.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Regularly evaluate your marginal tax rate, as this can influence your decisions. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

5. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**: Regardless of account type, ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Over time, your asset allocation may shift due to market performance. Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired distribution.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and objectives.
