(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, risk tolerance, and future financial goals. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Fund your traditional IRA to reduce taxable income, and consider a Roth IRA if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation and risk tolerance.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as they offer easier access without penalties.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your specific situation with professional guidance.

Next, check out that IRA loveâ€”if you think you might be in a higher tax bracket down the line, go for the Roth. If not, a traditional IRA can save you some bucks now.

For your taxable accounts, keep it fluid! You want easy access to some dough for emergencies or spontaneous adventures. Mix things up with some index funds and stocks, but donâ€™t go all-in on one thingâ€”diversificationâ€™s your best buddy.
