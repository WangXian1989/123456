The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: These accounts often allow higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maxing this out if possible.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Use traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth or Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Diversify Contributions**: If possible, contribute to both types for tax diversification.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Final Considerations
- **Age and Timeline**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, whereas those closer to retirement should focus on liquidity and income.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your situation.
