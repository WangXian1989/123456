Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, you can typically invest in a range of assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with a lower tax burden, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Plan your withdrawals based on your tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so hold investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Revisit Allocations Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment performance.

By balancing contributions in this way, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes over time. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
