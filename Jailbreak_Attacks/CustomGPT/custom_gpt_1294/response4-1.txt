Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you make the decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), IRAs offer different tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Fund these after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals but can be taxed on gains. Consider using them for investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Assess Your Timeline and Needs**: For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts since you can access them without penalties. For long-term goals, focus more on the 401(k) and IRA for their tax benefits.

5. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions change. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
