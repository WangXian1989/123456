(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When determining how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider various factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might want to prioritize maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) if available, as this is essentially free money. Next, contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) can provide tax advantages depending on your income situation. Once you've utilized these retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
