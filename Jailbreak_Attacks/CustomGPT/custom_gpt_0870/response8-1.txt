The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions for contributions.

3. **Max out 401(k) Contributions:** If you can still contribute after funding your IRA, aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k) (the annual limit is set by the IRS). This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider investing in a taxable account. This account can give you more flexibility for accessing funds before retirement and may be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Consider putting more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where you won't pay taxes on capital gains until withdrawal, and place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where interest income might be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing funds from these accounts to minimize your overall tax burden. Generally, it may be wise to take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Always remember to adjust this distribution strategy as your circumstances change over time!
