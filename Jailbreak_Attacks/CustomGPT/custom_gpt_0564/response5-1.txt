(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, since they offer tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing at least enough to get that full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider putting money into an IRA (traditional or Roth). The Roth IRA has tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investing flexibility.

It's crucial to balance your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon, seeking diversified exposure across asset classes.
