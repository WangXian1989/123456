When deciding how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize maxing out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially “free money.” The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and older.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those over 50. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexible access to your money without penalties, even though you'll pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Higher-growth investments are often best placed in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more stable income-producing investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) may be better suited for a taxable account.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk while working toward your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
