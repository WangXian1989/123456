Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Contribution limits for IRAs are generally lower than for 401(k)s, so it's beneficial to take advantage of both if possible.

3. **Continue to Contribute to 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This account typically has higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider opening or contributing to a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility and can be used for short- to medium-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains tax implications on investments held in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the accounts you choose, ensure your investment portfolio is diversified. This minimizes risk and can enhance returns over time. Mix stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. Changes in the market can shift your portfolio, so it’s crucial to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
