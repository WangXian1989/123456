To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maximizing contributions here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages but can offer flexibility. Use them for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid tapping into retirement funds prematurely.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across different accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This means having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can offer personalized advice based on your entire financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Always consider your long-term financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance when deciding how to distribute your money among these accounts.
