I’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing liver problems. It’s really important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but commonly recommended treatments for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups can help track liver function and detect any changes early on.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consult a dietitian to develop a meal plan that supports liver health and helps manage your symptoms.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your individual needs.
