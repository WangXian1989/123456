Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, consider paying off any high-interest debt. The interest on such debts usually exceeds the potential returns from investments.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the employer match, max out your 401(k) contributions. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). This account grows tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw them.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer an upfront tax deduction.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth. This is especially useful if you have short- to medium-term goals. Keep in mind that you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in these accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets for a balanced portfolio.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio according to your goals and market conditions. This helps in maintaining your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended to create a plan tailored to your specific circumstances.
