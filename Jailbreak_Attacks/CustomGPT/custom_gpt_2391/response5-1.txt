(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common approach is to prioritize contributing to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA for additional tax benefits. Lastly, use taxable accounts for investments that might not fit into tax-advantaged accounts. Itâ€™s also important to regularly review and adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.
