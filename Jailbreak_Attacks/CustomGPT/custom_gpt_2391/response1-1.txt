The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Utilize IRAs for Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Balance Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix between tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) and taxable accounts. This strategy can help manage your tax liability in retirement, as you'll have a variety of options for withdrawals.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: If you prefer a more aggressive investment strategy, it may be wise to place higher-risk investments in your taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains have favorable tax treatment. Conversely, low-risk investments might be better suited for your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund First**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund – typically 3 to 6 months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Life changes, tax laws, and personal circumstances do too. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed.
