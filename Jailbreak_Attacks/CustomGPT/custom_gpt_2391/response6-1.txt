When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to look at your financial goals, tax implications, and overall retirement strategy. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and offers great immediate returns on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be an excellent vehicle for future tax-free income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed at capital gains rates. However, you can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates which are less than ordinary income rates.

3. **Diversify Assets**: Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Young investors generally can afford to take more risks with stocks, while those closer to retirement should consider more bonds for stability.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some funds in your taxable accounts for emergencies or opportunities. These funds are more accessible and provide flexibility without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws can affect your strategy. Review your allocations at least annually and make adjustments to stay aligned with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income to maximize the employer match
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit ($6,000 for individuals under 50; $7,000 for those 50 and older)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after contributing to your 401(k) and IRA can go here for investment flexibility.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Leverage Employer Benefits**: Don’t leave money on the table.
- **Tax Strategy Matters**: Plan distributions with taxes in mind.
- **Balance Needs & Long-Term Goals**: Ensure flexibility while preparing for retirement.

By understanding these elements and maintaining a proactive approach, you can effectively distribute your money across different accounts to optimize your wealth for both today and the future.
