Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown to guide you:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**
     - *Pros*: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer match, higher contribution limits.
     - *Cons*: Limited investment choices, penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
     - *Pros*: Tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA), more investment options.
     - *Cons*: Contribution limits, income restrictions for Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - *Pros*: Flexibility to withdraw anytime, no contribution limits.
     - *Cons*: Capital gains taxes on investments when sold.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - Consider your time horizon. Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Distribute more funds into accounts that offer tax advantages (401(k) and IRA) in higher-income years.
   - In lower-income years, consider converting Traditional IRA funds to Roth IRAs to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types, adjusting your asset allocation based on risk tolerance and life stage.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your account distributions and adjust contributions as necessary due to changes in income, expenses, or investment performance.

### Suggested Action Plan
- **Short-term Actions**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
  - Assess and adjust your current contributions based on your income and tax situation.
  
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Create a schedule to reevaluate your financial goals and account distributions annually.

### Key Indicators of Success
- Contribution rates to each account type are on target.
- Growth of retirement accounts meets or exceeds market averages.
- Tax efficiency in capital gains from taxable accounts.
