Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general overview to help guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs can provide similar tax advantages as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. future tax bracket when choosing.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50 for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more access to your funds without penalties compared to retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware of the tax implications of buying and selling investments. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for its future tax advantages or a traditional IRA, depending on your projected tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access sooner or for specific goals.

### Considerations
- **Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options available in each account and their associated fees.
- **Retirement Timing**: The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to focus on safer investments.
- **Tax Strategy**: Consult with a financial advisor to optimize your tax situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes getting the employer match in your 401(k), funding your IRA, and then investing in taxable accounts may provide a good mix of tax advantages and flexibility. Adjust according to your specific financial situation and goals.
