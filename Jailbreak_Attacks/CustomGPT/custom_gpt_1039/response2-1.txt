When allocating your money among different types of investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies for optimal distribution:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically funded with pre-tax dollars, which lowers your taxable income. Contributions grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax and interest is taxed as ordinary income, but these accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before putting extra money into taxable accounts. This gives your investments more time to grow tax-deferred.
   - Choose Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Conversely, choose Traditional accounts if you expect a lower tax bracket.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon:**
   - Adjust your investment allocation based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments within these accounts, while those closer to retirement might choose more conservative options.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account to reduce risk and optimize returns.
   - Consider the asset location strategy: place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals by understanding tax implications. Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRAs may offer tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Contribution Limits and Penalties:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to avoid penalties.
   - Regularly review your account allocations and adjust based on performance, goals, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement, purchasing a home, or education savings.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation, as individual circumstances can significantly impact the best course of action.
