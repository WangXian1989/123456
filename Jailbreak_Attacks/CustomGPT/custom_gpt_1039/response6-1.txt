To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Allocate more to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. This lets you defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate less immediate tax liability, such as ETFs or index funds, which may yield long-term capital gains instead of ordinary income.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - **401(k):** Get a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Consider target-date funds for a diversified portfolio that adjusts as you near retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Include income-generating investments, but be mindful of the tax implications.

4. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio:**
   - Review your asset allocation annually and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution that maximizes your long-term growth while managing tax liabilities.
