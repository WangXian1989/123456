Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts first (like 401(k) and IRA). These accounts offer tax benefits either when you contribute (traditional accounts) or when you withdraw (Roth accounts).

3. **Consider the Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to traditional accounts may lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your current and expected future tax rates should influence how you allocate funds.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Mix stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your investment distribution based on life changes, market performance, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation to create a comprehensive strategy that maximizes your retirement savings.

A balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each account type, alongside regular review and adjustments, will help you effectively distribute your money for long-term growth and financial security.
