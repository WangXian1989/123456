The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach that might help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxable.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: With a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Depending on your income, choose the option that offers the best tax benefits for you.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund of 3-6 months of expenses before committing all your disposable income into these accounts.

4. **Assess Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA. If they offer limited choices or high fees, you might prioritize funding a taxable account, where you can have a broader range of investments and more control.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of where you place your money, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out your retirement accounts, consider putting funds into taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility in withdrawals without penalty (though remember you'll owe taxes on any gains).

7. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to stay consistent with your investment strategy.

8. **Review Periodically**: As your financial situation changes, review your distributions annually to ensure they align with your current goals.

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific needs and situation. They can provide personalized insights that take your whole financial picture into account.
