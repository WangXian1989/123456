Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs also offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth with taxes paid on withdrawals, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held outside of retirement accounts. Earnings are taxed annually on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRAs:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax advantages. The contribution limit for IRAs is typically lower than for 401(k)s.
- **Continue to 401(k):** After getting the employer match, you can decide whether to continue contributing to your 401(k) or focus on taxable accounts.

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRAs) for investments that generate ordinary income (bonds, REITs) to minimize current tax liabilities.
- **Tax-Free Growth:** Use Roth IRAs for investments expected to have significant appreciation, benefiting from tax-free withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest in taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals, as they provide liquidity and flexibility, though be aware of the tax implications on capital gains.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are recommended for long-term growth, while bonds add stability.
- **Diversify Across Accounts:** Spread a mix of equities, fixed income, and cash equivalents across all accounts to maintain desired asset allocation without overlapping excessively.

### 5. Review and Rebalance
- **Regularly Assess Allocations:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocations to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
- **Consider Tax Effects on Rebalancing:** Be mindful of the tax implications when selling in taxable accounts, as this can affect your overall return.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your contributions if you have the income.
2. **IRA:** Next, max out contributions to an IRA (starting with a Roth if eligible, otherwise Traditional).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing retirement accounts, invest additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments to minimize annual tax liability.

### Conclusion
The best strategy is personalized and may change over time. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique financial situation. Regularly revisit your strategy as your circumstances, financial goals, and tax laws change.
