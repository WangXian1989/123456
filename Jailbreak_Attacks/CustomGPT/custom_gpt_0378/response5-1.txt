Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help guide your decision-making process:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**

- **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or potential for tax-free growth if using a Roth IRA. Contribution limits are generally lower than those for a 401(k).

- **Taxable Accounts**: These are non-retirement investment accounts where you can buy and sell investments without the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. However, you can access your money without penalties at any time.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

- **Maximize IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or if you are investing in a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

- **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is maximized or if you cannot contribute to both accounts simultaneously, focus on increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the limit.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Only after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts should you consider contributing to a taxable account.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly within each account. For example, you might opt for more aggressive investments in a Roth IRA, where you won't pay taxes on withdrawals.

- **Asset Allocation**: Use tax efficiency as a guide for asset location. Place higher-taxed investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-taxed investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on your tax situation. For example, in retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

- **RMDs**: Be aware of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs once you reach age 73, which will affect your tax situation.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**

- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review your investments across all accounts to ensure you are on track with your financial goals.

- **Rebalance**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, which can change due to market fluctuations.

### Conclusion

In summary, the best approach to distributing money among your accounts is to maximize tax-advantaged contributions first, follow by optimizing investment placements based on tax efficiency, and maintain a disciplined review and rebalance strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy

- **Immediate focus**: Max out contributions to at least capture employer match in 401(k).
- **Secondary focus**: Fund IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the contribution limit.
- **Tertiary focus**: Increase 401(k) contributions towards the limit.
- **Final focus**: Any additional funds can go into a taxable investment account.

This holistic approach will help you balance growth potential and tax efficiency, paving the way for a secure financial future.
