1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune hepatitis.
   - **Insulin Sensitizers**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests or imaging studies.

4. **Quit Alcohol**:
   - Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage if alcohol-related.

5. **Manage Comorbid Conditions**:
   - Control conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, such as cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be considered.
