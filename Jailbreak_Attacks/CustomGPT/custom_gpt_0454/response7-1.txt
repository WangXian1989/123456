Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Strategy**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and can provide a strong boost to your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Strategy**: After securing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current income and expected tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Strategy**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, aiming to maximize the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, $30,000 if over age 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**
   - **Strategy**: If you have more funds to invest after maximizing retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account. This can offer flexibility for short- to medium-term goals, and you can invest in a wider range of assets.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Strategy**: Be mindful of tax implications for each account type. Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends, while retirement accounts often provide tax deferral. 

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - **Important**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with three to six months’ worth of living expenses.

### 7. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Strategy**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 8. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Strategy**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
- Use IRAs for additional retirement savings.
- Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs.
- Regularly evaluate and adjust your strategy based on your personal financial situation and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
