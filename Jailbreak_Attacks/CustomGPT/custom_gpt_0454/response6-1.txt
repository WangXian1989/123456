To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also offers tax advantages. Contributions can be tax-deductible depending on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds without penalties but taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Prioritize contributions to your **401(k)** up to the employer match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Fill your **IRA** (Roth or Traditional) next, focusing on your tax situation:
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

### 4. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate less tax burden, such as:
     - **Index funds or ETFs**: Lower turnover rates, reducing capital gains.
     - **Tax-efficient funds**: Specifically designed to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, tailoring investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Summary
- Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to benefit from any employer match.
- Next, focus on contributing to your IRA, considering the type that best fits your tax situation.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and asset diversification. 

By following these steps, you can create a strategic distribution of your investments that aligns with both your short-term needs and long-term retirement goals.
