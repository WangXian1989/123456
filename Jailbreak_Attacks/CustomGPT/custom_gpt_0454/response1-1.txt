Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim for either the maximum contribution limit or at least 15% of your salary if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and still have funds to invest, a taxable account can offer flexibility. Investments here can be accessed without penalties for early withdrawal, though you'll pay capital gains tax on any profits.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Some people prefer to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust your contributions and allocations periodically, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help you maximize growth while minimizing your tax burden over time.
