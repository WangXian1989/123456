Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, making it a good option if you expect higher income in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any investment income is taxed annually, so consider holding investments that yield lower taxable income (like index funds) in these accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Generally:
     - **Aggressive Growth:** Higher-risk investments like stocks may be better suited for retirement accounts since they have longer time horizons.
     - **Income Generation:** Bonds and dividend-paying stocks can be placed in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

### 4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Regularly review and adjust the asset allocation across all accounts. Keep an eye on overall risk and ensure youâ€™re not overly concentrated in any single type of investment.

### 5. **Match Withdrawals to Accounts**
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider where to draw funds from based on current tax brackets and your financial needs. 

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k):** Max out to get employer match, then contribute up to IRS limits (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, plus a $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).
- **IRA:** Contribute enough to max out (for 2023, the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional savings for flexibility, focusing on long-term growth or income, depending on your goals.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, ensuring you consider your overall financial picture, including debt, savings goals, and lifestyle preferences.
