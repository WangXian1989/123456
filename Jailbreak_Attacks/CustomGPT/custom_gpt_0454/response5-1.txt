Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term:** Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and savings. Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and strive to reach them if possible.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency in Investments**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Ideal for bonds and highly appreciated assets to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced investment across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) while considering the investment horizon and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on life changes (new job, family changes) or market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
