Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account may be more beneficial.
   - If you’re currently in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA may be better, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Consider Investment Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for retirement (20+ years away), you might prioritize long-term growth investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - For shorter-term goals (5-10 years), a taxable account may be more appropriate, as it can provide more liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for broad-based investments (like index funds) for long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that generate lower capital gains (like stocks held for over a year) or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Keep an Eye on Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings efficiently.

### 6. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and ensure proper asset allocation.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **401(k):** 50% of total retirement savings
- **IRA:** 30% of total retirement savings
- **Taxable Account:** 20% of total retirement savings

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances and goals.
