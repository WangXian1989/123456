Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs can give you tax deductions now.

3. **Focus on Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). This can help build your retirement savings, especially if it has lower fees.

4. **Address Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividend income. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Generally better for bonds and high-yield assets to defer taxes until withdrawal.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Use a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

It's essential to tailor your approach to your unique circumstances and goals.
