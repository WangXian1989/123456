To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, benefiting from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities when selling.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to diversify your investments and reduce risk.
   - Ensure asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to reflect changes in the market and your personal financial situation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account type.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
