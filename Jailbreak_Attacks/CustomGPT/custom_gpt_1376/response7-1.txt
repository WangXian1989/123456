Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) (especially if your employer offers matching contributions) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

### 2. **Understand Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for assets that generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding investments here for longer periods to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds:** Typically, more aggressive investments like stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts (where you're shielded from immediate taxes), while more conservative investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Withdrawal Timing:** Plan how and when you will withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) are taxed as ordinary income, so balance withdrawals to manage your tax bracket effectively.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If retirement is approaching, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially to receive employer match.
- **Traditional IRA:** Contribute up to the limit ($6,500 in 2023; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider adding funds here as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your personal situation, ensuring optimal growth and tax efficiency.
