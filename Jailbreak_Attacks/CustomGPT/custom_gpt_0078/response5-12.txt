I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your diagnosis, such as hepatitis, medications like antivirals or corticosteroids may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some individuals explore herbal supplements or other alternative treatments, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider first.

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
