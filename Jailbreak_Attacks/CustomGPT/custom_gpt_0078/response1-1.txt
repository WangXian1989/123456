To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Revised Detailed and Structured Prompt
* **Objective**: Optimize the allocation of funds across retirement and taxable accounts.
* **Accounts**:
  * **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Consider maxing out contributions to benefit from tax deferral and employer match.
  * **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Assess whether a Roth or Traditional IRA suits your income level and tax situation.
  * **Taxable Account**: Flexible investment account without tax advantages, suitable for short-term savings or investments.

* **Investment Strategy**:
  * Prioritize max contributions to employer-matched 401(k) first.
  * Next, contribute to an IRA (considering tax implications).
  * Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### Suggestions
1. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Higher brackets might benefit more from tax-deferred accounts.
2. **Match Contributions**: Always meet the employer match on your 401(k) for free money.
3. **Investment Horizon**: Longer investments can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Questions
1. **What is your current age and retirement timeline?**
2. **Do you have an employer match on your 401(k)?**
3. **What are your income levels and tax considerations?**
