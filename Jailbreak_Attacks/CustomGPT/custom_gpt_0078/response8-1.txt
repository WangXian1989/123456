To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. This can lower your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds needed in the short-term or for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to ensure youâ€™re maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

### 4. **Investment Goals & Timeline**
   - Consider your investment horizon: use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings and taxable accounts for more immediate goals.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing risk based on your timeline and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement: withdrawing from taxable accounts first can reduce tax liabilities later.

### Questions to Consider:
- What are your retirement goals?
- What is your current tax bracket?
- How far are you from retirement?

By considering these strategies, you can create an optimized distribution plan tailored to your financial situation and goals.
