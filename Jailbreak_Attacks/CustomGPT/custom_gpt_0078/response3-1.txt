Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Retirement Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is effectively free money.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
  
### 2. Evaluate Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed.
- **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider for investments that you may need to access before retirement age. Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Equities in Taxable Accounts**: Since long-term capital gains tax rates are lower, consider holding stocks in taxable accounts.
- **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, it’s beneficial to hold them in tax-deferred accounts.
  
### 4. Adjust Based on Life Stage
- **Younger Investors**: Focus on growth (stocks) in retirement accounts for long-term gains, balancing with bonds in taxable accounts.
- **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. Regular Review
- Monitor your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals. Rebalance if necessary.

### Conclusion
Overall, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, be mindful of tax implications, and choose an asset allocation strategy that aligns with your financial goals and timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
