Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.
   - If eligible, maximize contributions to the IRA after contributing to the 401(k) match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - If you have additional funds, allocate to taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Invest in Roth accounts if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on personal circumstances.

### Summary
1. **Maximize 401(k) match.**
2. **Contribute to IRAs.**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts as needed.**
4. **Be mindful of your tax situation.**
5. **Rebalance periodically.**
6. **Consult a professional for personalized guidance.**

Make sure to adjust these strategies based on your specific financial situation.
