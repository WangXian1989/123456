Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match since itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, making it a great way to save for retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be aware of how investment gains will be taxed, especially if you hold investments for less than a year.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to IRA** (consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible).
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts** for flexibility and potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### Final Thoughts:
Adjust contributions based on your needs, and consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
