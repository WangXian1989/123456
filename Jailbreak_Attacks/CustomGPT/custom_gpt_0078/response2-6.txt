3. **Engage Through Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive content that encourages participation and fosters a sense of community.

4. **Collaborate with Influencers**: Partner with influencers and activists who resonate with young audiences to amplify your message.

5. **Utilize Live Events and Online Forums**: Host town halls, webinars, or Q&A sessions that allow for direct engagement and discussion about pressing issues.

6. **Make Voting Easy**: Provide clear information on how to register, vote, and understand ballots. Mobile apps can be useful for reminders and updates.
