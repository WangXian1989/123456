Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions are after-tax but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between the two.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Remember that contribution limits are lower for IRAs compared to 401(k)s, so maximize these accounts as well depending on your eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good choice for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** When investing in taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

**Strategy:**
- If you have immediate savings goals, you might want to prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
- For long-term retirement savings, allocate more towards your 401(k) and IRA.
- Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances and to maximize tax efficiency.
