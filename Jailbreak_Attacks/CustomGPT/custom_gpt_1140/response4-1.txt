Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can, as it reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you have the means, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or if you wish to access funds without penalties before retirement age. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) within your taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Bonds and high turnover funds should generally be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to delay taxes.

5. **Persona Financial Situation:** Always consider your unique circumstances—including age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline—when determining how to allocate your funds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals by rebalancing as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

This allocation can significantly impact your retirement savings, so careful planning is key.
