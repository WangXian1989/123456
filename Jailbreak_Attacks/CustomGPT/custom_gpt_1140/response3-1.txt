Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations and a general strategy:

1. **Understand the Types of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan that may include tax benefits. Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You pay taxes on any capital gains, dividends, and interest earned.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Contributions:** Max out contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deductions and compound growth.
   - **Withdrawals:** Consider your tax bracket both now and in retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are usually taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Investment Objectives:**
   - If you're investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need flexibility or may require funds before retirement age, allocate more to taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or revisions to your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice and a detailed allocation strategy suited to your individual circumstances, consider working with a financial advisor.

**Example Allocation Strategy:**
- Max out 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match.
- Contribute to an IRA up to the maximum limit.
- After maxing out tax-deferred accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility.

**General Rule of Thumb:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or unexpected expenses.
