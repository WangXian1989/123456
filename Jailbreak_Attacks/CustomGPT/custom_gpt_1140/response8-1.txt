The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary based on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as these accounts can provide tax advantages as well. 

2. **Tax Impact Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax and can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, usually in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they do not offer the same tax advantages, they provide flexibility and easier access to your funds without penalties. Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term retirement savings (like in your 401(k) and IRA), consider a more aggressive investment strategy (more stocks, less bonds) compared to your taxable account, where you might want to take a more conservative approach.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize tax liabilities. Withdraw funds from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow as long as possible.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your investments according to changes in market conditions and personal circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
