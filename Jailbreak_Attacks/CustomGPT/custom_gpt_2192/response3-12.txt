I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

A healthcare provider can give you the most accurate diagnosis and treatment plan based on your condition.
