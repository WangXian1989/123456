The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After that, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Avoid placing high-turnover assets here to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk and optimize potential returns.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Align the investments in each account with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments can be in more aggressive assets (stocks), while shorter-term needs might be in more stable securities (bonds).

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that meets your financial needs. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
