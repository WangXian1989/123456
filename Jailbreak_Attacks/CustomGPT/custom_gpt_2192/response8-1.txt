The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs since they provide tax benefits.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates when choosing between traditional and Roth accounts. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term savings (retirement), focus on accounts with tax advantages.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider more liquidity in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may provide more flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts may be best for long-term growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so consulting a financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy.

By following these principles, you can effectively distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
