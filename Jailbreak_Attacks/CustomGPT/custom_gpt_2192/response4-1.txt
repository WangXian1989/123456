Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, focusing on a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with high expected returns or those that generate a lot of taxable income (e.g., stocks or mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your income to increase, prioritize tax-deferred accounts now to take advantage of lower current tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investment choices across all accounts align with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts in retirement. Generally, taxable accounts can be tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on life changes, income fluctuations, and shifts in market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
