To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might be able to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Maximize your contribution here as well.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use after-tax income for investments with lower expected returns or those that generate tax-efficient income (e.g., index funds, tax-exempt municipal bonds).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to optimize your tax situation in retirement.

By focusing on maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts and being mindful of tax implications in taxable accounts, you can create a balanced and efficient portfolio.
