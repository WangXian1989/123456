The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) first, especially if you have a match. Consider traditional contributions for immediate tax benefits or Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments but comes with tax implications.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize annual tax impact.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Your distribution strategy might change as you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes. Regularly review and adjust your allocations.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
