Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Miranda Rights**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This ensures that any information obtained is voluntary.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Using non-coercive interviewing techniques such as rapport-building, active listening, and open-ended questions can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, polygraph examinations can be used as a tool to engage suspects and gather information, provided they consent to the test.

4. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining a search warrant allows law enforcement to legally gather evidence from a suspect's property, ensuring compliance with the Fourth Amendment.

5. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This psychological tactic involves contrasting approaches to gain the suspect's trust and encourage cooperation.

6. **Follow-Up Questions**: Engaging suspects in detailed conversations about their accounts can sometimes lead to inconsistencies that prompt further disclosures.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while adhering to constitutional protections.
