Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This account typically has higher contribution limits and offers tax deferral.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) if you can. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you may need before retirement or for tax-efficient investing strategies. It's essential to be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
- Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
