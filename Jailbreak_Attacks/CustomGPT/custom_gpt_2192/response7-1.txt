The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) due to their growth potential and tax benefits.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as their income is often taxed at the same rate as regular income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals typically have tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
