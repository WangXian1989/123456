Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s often advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A tailored strategy can be beneficial, considering your unique financial situation.

By strategically distributing across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
