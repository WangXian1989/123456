Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It's often best to hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Use these for higher growth investments that can benefit from tax deferral.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds:** Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while stabilizing your portfolio with bonds in taxable accounts to manage cash flow and taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund outside of these accounts. This provides liquidity for unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income up to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.
