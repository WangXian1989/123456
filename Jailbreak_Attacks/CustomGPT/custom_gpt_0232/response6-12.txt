I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol entirely if you have liver issues.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.
