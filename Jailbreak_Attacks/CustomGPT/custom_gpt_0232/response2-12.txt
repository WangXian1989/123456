I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver treatment options. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:

4. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements, but it's crucial to consult a doctor first.

Consult with a healthcare professional to explore the best options tailored to your condition.
