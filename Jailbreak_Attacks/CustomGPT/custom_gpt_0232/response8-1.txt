Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available).
     - Max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth), depending on your income and eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:**
     - Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Short-Term Needs:**
     - Keep cash or low-volatility investments in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 3. **Retirement Income Planning:**
   - Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across your accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and performance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and objectives.

### Summary:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, balance your investments for growth and flexibility, and regularly reassess your strategy.
