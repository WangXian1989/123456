Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) for the tax-deferred growth.

4. **Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds, consider funding a traditional IRA. This can also provide tax benefits.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings or investments beyond tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your unique situation.
