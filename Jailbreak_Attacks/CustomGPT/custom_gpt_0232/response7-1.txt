Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA for the tax advantages.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, focus on paying that off before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower turnover and dividends, such as ETFs or index funds, to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes and sectors.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
