Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be advantageous for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds) that may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider discussing your specific circumstances with a financial advisor.

Adjust the above based on your personal risk tolerance and future financial goals.
