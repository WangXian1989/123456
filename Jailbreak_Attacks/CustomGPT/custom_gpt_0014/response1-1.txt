Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages, depending on your income level.

### 3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing extra funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts, such as ETFs and index funds, which generate fewer capital gains.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a good mix of investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for risk management.

### 6. **Adjust for Retirement Timeline**
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - To tailor the strategy to your specific situation, especially considering tax implications and investment goals.

### Final Note
Continuously review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and personal financial changes.
