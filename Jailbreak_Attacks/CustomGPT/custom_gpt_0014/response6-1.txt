Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. If possible, maximize your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for extra savings. This can include investments in stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds that you plan to hold for the long term to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement:** Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts with a diversified portfolio.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for accessible funds. Choose lower-risk investments to preserve capital.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Tips:
- **Watch Contribution Limits:** Keep track of annual contribution limits for each account type.
- **Be Tax Conscious:** Consider the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts, especially if you've realized gains.

This strategy can help optimize your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.
