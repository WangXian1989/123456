Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contribute to max out the annual limit if you can.
   - **IRA:** 
     - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access if you expect to need funds before retirement.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains instead of regular income, as long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in all accounts. 

### 5. **Review Performance and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changing personal circumstances or market conditions.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid savings before prioritizing investments.
- **Debt:** Pay off high-interest debt before aggressively investing.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement to strategize withdrawals favorably.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
