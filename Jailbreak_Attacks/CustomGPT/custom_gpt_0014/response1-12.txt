I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Healthy diet (low in fats and sugars)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antivirals for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular doctor visits for blood tests and ultrasounds.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
