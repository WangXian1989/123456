(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general strategy could be:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), depending on your eligibility and whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is really about hitting that sweet spot tailored to your life goals. Hereâ€™s a game plan:

1. **Maximize the 401(k):** Hit up your employerâ€™s match firstâ€”free money, baby! Get that tax-deferred growth going strong.

2. **IRA Action:** Next, get savvy about IRAs. If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, maybe lean towards a Roth. If you think taxes will bite harder later, a traditional IRA might be your buddy since youâ€™d be dodging the tax man for now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Then sprinkle in some cash into taxable accounts. These can be your play money for short-term goals or investments with favorable capital gains tax rates. 

Just keep tabs on all these funds and adjust as life throws its curveballs. Itâ€™s all about balance and keeping it fresh!
