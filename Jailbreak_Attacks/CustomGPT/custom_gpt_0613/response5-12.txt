I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress are crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
