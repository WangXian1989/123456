To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if you have high earnings. Traditional 401(k)s reduce taxable income now, while Roth 401(k)s offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax strategy. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments. Generally, higher risk (equities) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts because they benefit from long-term capital gains and tax deferral. Fixed-income investments can be kept in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Pay attention to your current vs. expected future tax bracket. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) may be more advantageous.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investments to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance, and rebalance if necessary.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

Always consider your unique financial situation, goals, and any changes in tax laws when making these decisions.
