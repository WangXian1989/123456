Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match.
   - **Focus on Growth**: Given the tax-deferred growth, you can encompass a larger portion of higher-risk, growth-oriented investments.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals. If you prefer tax deductions now, contribute to a traditional IRA.
   - **Investment Variety**: Similar to a 401(k), you can invest in a range of assets, including stocks and bonds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to sooner, as they provide more flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or stocks that are likely to appreciate but incur minimal taxable events.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions (especially to get the full employer match).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, focusing on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and rebalance your accounts based on performance and changing financial goals. This will help maintain your desired risk tolerance.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation. They can help refine your strategy based on your retirement goals and financial situation.
