Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and consider holding low-turnover stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep an eye on your portfolio allocations and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best distribution will be tailored to your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized insights.
