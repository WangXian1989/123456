Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize this match first. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After getting the match, focus on tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Contribution limits are generally lower than a 401(k), so maximizing these accounts can reduce your taxable income or provide tax-free growth.

### 3. **Account Types and Their Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your current taxable income. Generally, the employee limits for contributions are higher.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, it can provide tax benefits now or tax-free growth later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for more immediate goals or investments that may generate taxable income.

### 4. **Consider Investment Allocation**
   - Ensure that the investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might choose a more aggressive allocation in a 401(k) for long-term growth while keeping your taxable account more conservative if you plan to access those funds sooner.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice specific to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your overall financial picture.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes your financial growth while considering tax implications.
