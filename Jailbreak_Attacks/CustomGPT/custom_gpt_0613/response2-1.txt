Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are typically $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications:**
   - Depending on your tax bracket, traditional accounts may provide a tax deduction today but could incur taxes upon withdrawal. Roth accounts, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider your asset allocation based on risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, more aggressive investments like stocks can be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts due to potential growth and compounding, while bonds might be better for taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on interest income.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts. This helps manage risk and can provide more flexibility in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations, especially as you near retirement, and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure about your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts.
