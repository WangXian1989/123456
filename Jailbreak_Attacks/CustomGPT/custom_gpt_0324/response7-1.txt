To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Take advantage of employer matching contributions first, if available. The 2023 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing taxable income in the short term. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for profit. Focus on long-term holdings to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since these accounts are typically for long-term retirement. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to mitigate tax impacts.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target investment mix.
