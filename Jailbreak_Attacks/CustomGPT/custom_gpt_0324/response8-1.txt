Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Benefits from tax-deferred growth. Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, this can be a great option for tax-free growth, especially for younger earners or those in lower tax brackets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals but can incur capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and not just within one account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will access these funds in retirement. Tax implications vary for each account type, so think ahead about how you'll draw funds.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your unique financial situation, consider consulting a professional.

Evaluating your specific situation regularly is key to optimizing your investment strategy.
