To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the match, then consider maxing out an IRA if eligible.
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions if you're eligible for a Roth or traditional IRA, benefiting from tax advantages.

3. **Consider Taxation**: 
   - **Friends in the 401(k)**: This account grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRAs**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments expected to produce capital gains, as they are taxed differently than ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a cash or taxable account to cover emergencies.

5. **Investment Choices**: Choose investments with the highest growth potential for tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit most from tax deferral.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations among accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals.

By having a strategy that considers both short-term and long-term needs, you can optimize your overall financial health. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
