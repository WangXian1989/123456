Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After you maximize your match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, you can go back to your 401(k). Try to aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest, consider taxable accounts for flexibility. This might be useful for investments you plan to access before retirement.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your strategy should evolve with changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
