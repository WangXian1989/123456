Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Typically has limited investment choices; ensure they align with your strategy.
   - **IRA**: Offers a wider range of options, allowing for diversified investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may provide immediate withdrawal benefits, like stocks or bonds not subject to early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income; typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from these accounts when in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Better for investments with favorable capital gains treatment—hold assets for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Market Changes**: Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it meets your changing financial landscape and goals.

### Summary
- **Prioritize matching contributions** in your 401(k).
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts** first.
- **Diversify across accounts** based on liquidity needs and tax implications.

By strategically distributing funds, you can optimize growth, reduce tax liabilities, and better meet your financial objectives.
