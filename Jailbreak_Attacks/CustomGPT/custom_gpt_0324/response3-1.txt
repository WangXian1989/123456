To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or other long-term goals?

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if youqualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for goals that are shorter-term or for funds you need more access to without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in your 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.
   - Taxable accounts should hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these have lower tax rates.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and rebalance as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a professional to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a well-structured plan for distributing your funds across your accounts.
