(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Fund IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth. 

Keep in mind factors like tax implications, withdrawal rules, and your overall investment strategy.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s your last chance at free pizza. Don't leave money on the table!
2. **IRA Magic**: Next, throw some cash into your IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth if you qualifyâ€”like a cheat code for your retirement!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once youâ€™ve milked those two for all theyâ€™re worth, dive into taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax perks, but they offer flexibility and liquidityâ€”think of them as your backup dancers ready to step in when needed.

Balance it all according to your risk tolerance, goals, and how likely you are to need that cash! Get after it!
