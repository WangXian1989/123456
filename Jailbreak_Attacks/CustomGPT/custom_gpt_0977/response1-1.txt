Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings in a taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies, as funds in retirement accounts can incur penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across accounts, considering the tax implications. For example:
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.
   - Consider holding bond funds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts, as these can incur higher taxes when held in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This is a foundation to consider, and it's important to adjust based on your unique circumstances and goals.
