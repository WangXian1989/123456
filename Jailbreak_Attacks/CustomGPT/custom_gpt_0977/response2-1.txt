Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is effectively free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (in retirement) are tax-free, including earnings if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in a taxable account for immediate access to funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

### 3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - **Prioritize Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maximizing your IRA contribution (up to the annual limit). If you have additional funds, go back to your 401(k) or consider a Roth IRA if eligible.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account based on your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Revisit your asset allocation and distributions annually or as your financial situation changes (e.g., job changes, income fluctuations).

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contribution (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility).
3. Contribute additional funds to your 401(k) if you still have money to invest.
4. Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation, keeping in mind factors like age, retirement goals, and income level. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
