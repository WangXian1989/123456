(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advantageous to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA, which can provide tax advantages. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

You don’t want to leave free money on the table, right? Next up, slide some cash into an IRA for those sweet tax breaks. Whether it’s a Roth or a traditional IRA will depend on your income and tax strategy, but get the ball rolling! After you’ve maxed out those accounts, it’s time to splash some cash into taxable accounts – think of it as your “fun money” for investments where you can cash out without locking yourself into retirement constraints. Just remember, the key is diversification, so spread that wealth wisely and keep an eye on those 'tax implications' too!
