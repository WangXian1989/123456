When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before directing additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Look at Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed annually, which can be less advantageous in the short term.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you plan to retire in the near future, a larger allocation to a 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial to minimize taxes on withdrawals. If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous due to tax-free growth.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across all accounts. You might choose to hold different asset types in each account based on their tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: If you have short-term cash needs or goals, prioritize contributions to your taxable account or maintain a cash reserve.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and investment performance, adjusting according to changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an allocation strategy that fits your specific circumstances and goals.
