Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay income tax on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts before investing aggressively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice that aligns with your specific circumstances.
