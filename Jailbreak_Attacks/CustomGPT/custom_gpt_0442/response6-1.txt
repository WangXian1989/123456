Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out this account next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains typically have lower tax rates than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 3. **Factor in Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some liquid assets in your taxable account for short-term needs while allowing retirement accounts to grow without the penalty of early withdrawals.

### 4. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - Longer time horizons can afford to be more aggressive with investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter time horizons may warrant a more conservative approach.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your changing goals and market conditions.

### Summary:
- Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially if employer matching is available.
- Assess your overall tax strategy to optimize asset distribution.
- Maintain liquid assets for immediate needs, balancing growth and risk across each account.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as individual factors can vastly change the recommended approach.
