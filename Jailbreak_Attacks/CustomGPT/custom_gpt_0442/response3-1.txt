To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the traditional IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA** (Traditional vs. Roth): Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but allow for greater flexibility with withdrawals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This helps manage risk.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Allocate more to growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in accounts with longer time horizons (typically 401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you need the money sooner.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial planner to create a personalized strategy based on your financial situation and goals. 

By strategically allocating your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages and prepare for a secure retirement.
