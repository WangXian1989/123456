The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions here, especially if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher capital gains, as long-term gains are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Divide your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities can be held in tax-advantaged accounts (due to higher growth potential) and fixed income in taxable accounts where the tax impact can be less beneficial.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired level of risk and return, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Consider your own retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and whether you want to minimize taxes now or in the future. Each individual's situation can vary significantly, so tailor your distribution strategy accordingly.
