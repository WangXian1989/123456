Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s how to approach it:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals are taxed in retirement. Match contributions if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, so investing for the long term here can minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider a broader range of investments, possibly including international stocks or alternative assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxable distributions.

### 4. **Contribution Priorities**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
   - Contribute to an IRA next, prioritizing a Roth if you qualify.
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, use additional funds for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and make adjustments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategies according to your specific situation for optimal results.

This balanced approach helps you maximize growth potential and minimize taxes over the long term.
