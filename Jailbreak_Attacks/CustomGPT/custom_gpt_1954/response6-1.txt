Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023.
   
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce taxable income, such as bonds or certain stocks. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals and liquidity.
   - **Investment Type**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use each account type to hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) for balanced growth and risk.
   - **Equities**: Typically have more growth potential, suitable for long-term IRA and 401(k) investments.
   - **Bonds**: Often better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate a higher percentage to stocks in accounts for long-term growth if you have a higher risk tolerance.
   - Shift towards safer investments like bonds as you approach your withdrawal phase.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your accounts and rebalance annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary Recommendations:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, prioritize contributions.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals, focus on tax-efficient investments.

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy according to your unique financial situation and goals.
