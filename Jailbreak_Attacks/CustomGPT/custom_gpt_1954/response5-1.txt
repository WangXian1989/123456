When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Understand Your Goals**: Consider your investment goals, time horizon, and tax situation. For short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), taxable accounts may be better. For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This includes various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and considering the tax implications of each account type.

5. **Allocate Based on Taxation**: Assets expected to grow significantly (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. More tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Adopting these strategies can help optimize your investments and tax advantages.
