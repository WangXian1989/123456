Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. They're taxed when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
      - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, with taxes payable upon withdrawal.
      - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - For tax diversification, consider having a mix of pre-tax accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax accounts (Roth IRA). This provides flexibility in retirement.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might favor equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds to reduce risk.

### 5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Taxable accounts can offer flexibility and liquidity but are less tax-efficient. Use them for investments that generate minimal taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth if eligible (if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement) or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings here, focusing on long-term and tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review
- Review your allocation at least annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, market conditions, and personal goals.

### Final Note
- Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
