Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute Enough:** At minimum, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contribution:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After securing the match, continue to fund your 401(k). Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs make this a great option.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for emergencies. This also allows more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment Options:** Consider investments that generate lower capital gains or losses, as taxes on these can erode returns in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider the Sequence of Contributions**
   - Depending on your income, tax bracket, and retirement timeline, you may choose to prioritize one account over another. For instance:
     - High-income years may warrant maximizing tax-deferred accounts first.
     - If expecting a lower income in the future, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments:** No matter the account type, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, especially if one account grows disproportionately.

### 6. **Monitor Tax Implications**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement. Having a mix can provide flexibility in managing tax liabilities.

### Summary
The best strategy depends on your unique circumstances, so it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your goals. Regularly reviewing your approach as your circumstances or market conditions change is also important.
