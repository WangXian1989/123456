Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Determine Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if you can utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred; you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually; prioritize investments to minimize taxes (e.g., index funds, tax-efficient funds).

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds, etc.) given the tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Account**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, with an emphasis on tax efficiency.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Adjust allocation based on your comfort with risk and potential market fluctuations.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Rebalance your investments annually to ensure alignment with your goals and market changes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 40% (if maxing out and getting employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (focus on long-term growth)
- **Taxable Account**: 30% (more liquid assets)

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider personalized advice based on your specific situation and changes in tax laws.

Regularly assess your holdings and stay informed about investment trends for optimal growth.
