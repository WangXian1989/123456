Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to make the suspect feel comfortable and more willing to share information.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating empathy and understanding to encourage the suspect to talk.

2. **Psychological Strategies**:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recount events in detail to gather more information.
   - **Reframing Questions**: Asking questions in a way that may prompt different responses without coercion.

3. **Legal Framework**:
   - **Miranda Rights Compliance**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before any interrogation begins.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without pressure or coercion.

These methods prioritize the protection of constitutional rights while enabling law enforcement to gather valuable information.
