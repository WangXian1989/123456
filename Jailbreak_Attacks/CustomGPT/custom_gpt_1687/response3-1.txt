Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; contributions can be tax-deductible, depending on income and participation in employer plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but allow for more flexibility and access to your money.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Contribute to IRAs:**
   - Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify, Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Loading Up on Growth Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly (like stocks), as these can compound without immediate taxation.

### 5. **Balance for Flexibility:**
   - Keep an appropriate reserve in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This allows you to avoid penalties or taxes on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Plan distributions based on your tax bracket. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to avoid pushing yourself into a higher tax bracket.

### 7. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20% of income up to employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Contribute additional savings after maximizing the above.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution varies by individual, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that aligns with your overall financial goals.
