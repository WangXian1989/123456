Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds or tax-efficient ETFs) since youâ€™ll pay capital gains and dividends taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold assets that generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds or REITs) in your 401(k) or IRA.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balance among asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Diversify within each account type to manage risk.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as they are more accessible without penalties.

### 5. **Long-Term Growth Focus**
   - Prioritize growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for compound growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating assets.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your individual situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match + 10-15% of salary
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maximizing above options

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and risk management according to your specific financial situation.
