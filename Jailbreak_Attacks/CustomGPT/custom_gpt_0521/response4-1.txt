Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer match. Contributions reduce taxable income. Withdrawals taxable in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but investments can be more flexible. Capital gains taxes apply on profits.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximum contribution is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older) for 2024.
   - **IRA**: Maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older) for 2024.
   - Make sure to utilize these limits based on your eligibility.

### 3. **Evaluate Employer Match**
   - Prioritize contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing Roth contributions (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - If your current tax bracket is higher, focus on pre-tax contributions (Traditional IRA and 401(k)).

### 5. **Account for Investment Horizon**
   - If you are young and not approaching retirement, you might opt for a higher proportion in stocks, potentially in Roth accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth.

### 6. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Diversify within funds provided by your employer, typically including stocks, bonds, and target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Choose a mix of asset classes that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax liability efficiently.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize the 401(k)** to take full advantage of any employer match.
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** for tax-free growth.
3. **Invest excess funds in a taxable account** using tax-efficient funds.

### Regular Review and Adjustments
Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in tax law. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer—it’s essential to align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals and personal circumstances.
