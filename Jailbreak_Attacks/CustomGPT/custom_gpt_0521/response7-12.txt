I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Supplements**: Some patients find liver supplements, like milk thistle, helpful, but it's crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies might be recommended to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or liver failure, options might include liver resection or liver transplantation.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition.
