Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**: This is employer-sponsored and offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching, which is a key benefit. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs allow tax-deferred growth; however, contributions might not be tax-deductible if your income exceeds certain limits. There are also Roth IRAs, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
  
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have special tax treatment. Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, and interest and dividends are typically taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get that full match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After securing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you are eligible for a Roth IRA, this could offer tax-free growth for qualified withdrawals.

3. **Further 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (if feasible), return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or after-tax investments. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of the tax implications on gains and dividends.

### 3. Investment Strategy

- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

- **Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax deferral, and consider more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts (like bonds or dividend stocks) to potentially benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly

Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
