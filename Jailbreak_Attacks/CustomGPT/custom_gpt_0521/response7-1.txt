Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions; often has higher contribution limits. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can be either traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Consider the tax implications based on your current income and expected future tax bracket.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investments not tied to retirement; earnings are taxed in the year they are realized. Useful for short- to mid-term goals.

### 2. Assess Your Goals
- **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments.
- **Short- to medium-term needs**: Use taxable accounts.

### 3. Contributions Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match (often considered "free money").
- **IRAs**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus funds here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- Invest in a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 
- Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.

### 5. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-efficient investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
- **Tax-loss harvesting**: In taxable accounts, sell investments at a loss to offset gains and reduce tax liability.

### 6. Review and Adjust Regularly
- Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Changing tax laws, personal circumstances, or market conditions may warrant adjustments in contributions or asset allocation.

### Example Distribution
- **If you earn $100,000 and max out a 401(k) ($20,500) and an IRA ($6,500)**, invest any extra in a taxable account.
- Distribution might look like:
  - 401(k): $20,500
  - IRA: $6,500
  - Taxable: Remainder of your investment budget.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation. This general strategy will help optimize your tax situation and achieve your financial goals.
