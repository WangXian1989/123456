Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal, and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Also offers tax advantages but has lower contribution limits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or goals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Allocate funds to a taxable account if you need access in less than five years.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have adequate liquid savings before heavily investing.

### 3. **Contribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, focusing on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds here for flexibility.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) & IRA Withdrawals:** Understand required minimum distributions (RMDs) in traditional accounts starting at age 73.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50% of retirement savings (max out to get employer match)
- **IRA:** 25% (either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% (for flexibility and short-term goals)

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution will depend on your unique situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. Regularly review and adapt your strategy as your financial situation evolves.
