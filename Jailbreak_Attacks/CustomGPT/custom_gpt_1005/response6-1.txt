To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then prioritize your IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Invest in low-capital gains stocks or index funds to minimize taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. long-term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (e.g., buying a home) and retirement accounts for long-term growth. 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify within accounts**: Maintain a suitable mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, but consider placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains. 

By balancing these factors according to your financial situation and goals, you can optimize your investment strategy.
