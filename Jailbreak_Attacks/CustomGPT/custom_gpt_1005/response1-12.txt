I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. Here are a few approaches that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are often recommended.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating related issues, like obesity or diabetes, can help improve liver function.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances can prevent further damage.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to get a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
