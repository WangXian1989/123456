Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. This will defer taxes on growth and withdrawals until retirement, potentially lowering your tax burden.

3. **IRA Options**: Choose between Traditional and Roth IRAs:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goalsâ€”short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term retirement savings should be in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By strategically distributing your money, you can optimize growth while managing your tax burden effectively.
