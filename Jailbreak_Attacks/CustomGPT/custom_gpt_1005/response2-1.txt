Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above options, invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Remember, tax implications vary, so consulting a financial advisor may be beneficial for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
