I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common liver treatment options that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), your doctor might prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and any potential complications.

4. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can reduce fatty liver disease and improve overall liver health.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult with a healthcare provider before starting any.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, surgical options may be considered, including liver transplantation.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
