To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you've secured the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility and the ability to access funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets should be in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy across different account types.
