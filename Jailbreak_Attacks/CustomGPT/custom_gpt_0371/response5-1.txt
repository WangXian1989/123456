The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) next. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Prioritize investments that maximize tax efficiency, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how withdrawals from each account type will affect your taxes in retirement. Generally, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, while 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

6. **Reassess and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
