I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver issues typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adjusting diet (reducing fats, sugars), increasing exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find support in supplements like milk thistle, but talk to a doctor first.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the condition.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.
