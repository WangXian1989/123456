Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate low taxes, such as ETFs or index funds. Avoid frequent trading to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Your Investments**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping more liquid or shorter-term investments here, as you may need to access these funds sooner.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough in your taxable accounts for near-term expenses while maximizing contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments across all accounts to preserve capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help create an optimal strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
