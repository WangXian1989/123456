To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Theyâ€™re ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax. Use them for investments you plan to hold less than a year or for specific savings goals.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Stay within the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50)
     - **IRA:** $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50)

### 4. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth without immediate tax impact.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, as they offer more flexibility without penalties.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 7. **Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages, retirement growth, and overall financial health.
