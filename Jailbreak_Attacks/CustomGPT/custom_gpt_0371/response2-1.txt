Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax benefits, investment goals, and timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest up to the maximum limit (if you can afford it). This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA after maxing out the 401(k) match. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or that don’t fit well in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment allocation across accounts is diverse. Maintain a balanced portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so review your allocations periodically.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
