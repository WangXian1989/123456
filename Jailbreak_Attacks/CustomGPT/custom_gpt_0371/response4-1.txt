To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to secure the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit, especially if you have a high-income year. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments not limited by age or penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation in each account.

6. **Future Withdrawals**: Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Withdrawals from traditional accounts may be taxed at your ordinary income rate, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free, impacting your strategy for distribution later on.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

Make sure to regularly review your contributions and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
