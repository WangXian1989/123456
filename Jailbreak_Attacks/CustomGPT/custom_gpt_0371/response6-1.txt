Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth if you meet certain income limits.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are for flexibility. Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-term (0-5 years)**: Consider keeping more in taxable accounts for easy access and liquidity.
   - **Long-term (5+ years)**: Focus on your 401(k) and IRA for compounding growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals, ensuring you maintain a risk profile that aligns with your financial objectives.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - If you have complex needs or significant assets, personalized advice can help optimize your strategy further.

Consider your specific situation and goals carefully.
