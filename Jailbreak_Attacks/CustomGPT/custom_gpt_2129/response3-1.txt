Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for assets that may generate lower tax liabilities, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund and address any high-interest debt.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, equities for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, and bonds or cash-equivalents in taxable accounts for income.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain desired risk levels and align with changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider seeking help from a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that suits your financial goals.
