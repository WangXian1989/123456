To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: If utilizing a traditional IRA, remember contributions may be tax-deductible. If you opt for a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), focus on 401(k) and IRA accounts due to their tax advantages.
   - If you need access to funds sooner, prioritize taxable accounts for their liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider different asset allocations based on risk tolerance and investment horizon for each account type. 
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts with a clear strategy, you'll optimize your investment growth while considering taxes and accessibility.
