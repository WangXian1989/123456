Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. This helps manage risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Tailor your investment strategy to your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk, while those closer to retirement should shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a separate account outside these investments to avoid early withdrawals, which can incur penalties and taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
