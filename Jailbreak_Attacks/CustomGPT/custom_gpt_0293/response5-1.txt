To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**  
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **401(k)**: Focus on high contributions here, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, also contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to benefit from tax deferrals or tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**  
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds).

### 4. **Investment Strategy**  
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage immediate tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Review**  
   - Annually reassess your allocation based on market performance, tax laws, and personal changes.

By balancing contributions in this way, you can take full advantage of tax benefits while preparing for both short-term and long-term financial goals.
