Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose diversified investments that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Evaluate Tax Benefits**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use for investments that you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify your Investments**: Across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation in line with your goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

By balancing these accounts effectively, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes both now and in retirement.
