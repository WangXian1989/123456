To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Advantaged Accounts)**: Maximize contributions to these accounts first. They offer tax deferral or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings or investments that might exceed the limits of tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less volatile or that generate tax-efficient income, such as qualified dividends or municipal bonds.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals considering tax implications. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all account types to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Age and Goals**:
   - Your age, financial goals, and expected retirement timeline will influence how to allocate funds. Younger individuals may prioritize growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on preservation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
