Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term goals can be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.

4. **Withdrawal Penalties**:
   - Funds in tax-advantaged accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal. Plan accordingly.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or for investments that generate capital gains.

### Periodic Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and tax law changes. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
