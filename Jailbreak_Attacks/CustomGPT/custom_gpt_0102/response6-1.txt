To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Similar benefits if it's a traditional IRA; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than income tax rates.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your **401(k)** for employer matches and fixed investments.
   - Allocate **IRA** funds towards higher growth potential (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep more liquid investments and lower-risk options in **taxable accounts** to manage taxes efficiently.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Goals**
   - Max out your **401(k)** and IRAs if possible, especially if you have employer matching.
   - Assess your goals: retirement needs vs. short-term liquidity to determine fund allocation.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term goals.
- Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio.
