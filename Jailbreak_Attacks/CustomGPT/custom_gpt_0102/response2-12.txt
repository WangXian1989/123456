1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Procedures**:
