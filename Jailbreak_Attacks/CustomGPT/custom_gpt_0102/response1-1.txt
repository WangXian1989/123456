Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match first. This is effectively free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to benefit from tax deferrals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Think about opening a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or for flexibility in withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations based on market performance and life changes.
