To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high income or short-term capital gains, as they may be taxed at a higher rate.
   - Keep assets that have the potential for long-term growth, which may appreciate in value, in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Balance Contributions**: Assess your overall financial situation to balance contributions across your accounts. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing circumstances, or new financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique financial situation.
