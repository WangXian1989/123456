The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k) (especially if you're not getting a match), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any money you want to invest beyond these retirement accounts can go into a taxable investment account. This is especially useful for short-term goals (like buying a house) or if you're nearing retirement and want to maintain flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Money in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs grows tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the earnings until you withdraw.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so long-term investments may fare better here.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts to manage risk and optimize taxes. For example, more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be placed in taxable accounts, while less efficient (like bonds) can be held in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

It may also be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
