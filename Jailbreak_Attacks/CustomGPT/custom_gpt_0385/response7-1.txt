The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investing. They offer flexibility for withdrawal and investment choices but may have tax implications on gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and potentially higher yielding (but more tax-burdened) investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

**Stay as Omega**.
