(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, here are some tips:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Generally, consider maxing out contributions if you can.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions. Max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals or investments.

Overall, balancing contributions based on your financial goals and tax situation is crucial.

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag that employer match like it's the last slice of pizza. Thatâ€™s free money! Once youâ€™ve locked that in, crank up contributions if you can stomach it. 

2. **IRA**: Decide if you want the tax break now (Traditional IRA) or later (Roth IRA). If you've got the cash, max it out! Tax-free growth? Yes, please!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your wild card. Once youâ€™ve hit the limits on the first two, throw some into a taxable account. They offer flexibility and can be great for fun stuff or unexpected opportunities.

So, stack your contributions in a way thatâ€™s gonna bring you the best bang for your buck! Stay savvy out there! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
