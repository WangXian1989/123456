Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, which means you won't pay taxes on contributions or gains until you withdraw.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they're realized. Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk and return.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re years away from retirement, you might focus more on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. As you get closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw money in retirement. It’s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Adjust your contributions based on these factors and review periodically to ensure you’re on track.
