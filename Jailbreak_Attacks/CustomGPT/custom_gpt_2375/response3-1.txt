To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Your Goals**: Determine your short, medium, and long-term financial goals. This will help inform your investment strategy.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers matching, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), this can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider using this account for investments that are less tax-efficient.

3. **Investment Mix**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, the longer the time until you need the money, the more risk you can take. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across asset classes to reduce risk.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make consistent contributions to each account, prioritizing those with tax benefits initially, like the 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly check your asset allocation and adjust according to changes in your goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If you are unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation. 

By balancing contributions based on tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance, you can optimize your overall investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
