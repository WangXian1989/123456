To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. Aim to max out contributions to your IRA if eligible (traditional or Roth).

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider more aggressive investments for long-term growth since withdrawals in retirement may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - For short-term goals or specific needs, keep investments in taxable accounts more conservative.

4. **Diversify Holdings**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Think About Withdrawals**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from these accounts may be taxed differently. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your investment goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If confused, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective approach to managing your investments.
