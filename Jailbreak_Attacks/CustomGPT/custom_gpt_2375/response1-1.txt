To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (after-tax, grows tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but funds are accessible anytime.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match, contribute to an IRA. If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, use any additional funds for taxable accounts, especially if you need flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Allocate investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) to tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) and keep investments that are more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in your financial situation and investment performance.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
