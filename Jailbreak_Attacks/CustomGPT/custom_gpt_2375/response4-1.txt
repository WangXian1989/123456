When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Determine Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. If you're in a higher bracket now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be better.

4. **Diversify Contributions**: Instead of putting all your money into one type of account, consider splitting contributions. For example, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then fund your IRA, and finally, contribute any remaining money to your taxable account.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies, as your retirement accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options in each account. Sometimes, it’s smarter to invest in higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk assets in taxable accounts.

7. **Long-Term Goals and Withdrawals**: Think about when you’ll need the money. For retirement savings, focus on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

8. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on your financial goals and market conditions.

Creating a balanced and tax-efficient strategy tailored to your individual circumstances will ultimately help in achieving your financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized assistance.
