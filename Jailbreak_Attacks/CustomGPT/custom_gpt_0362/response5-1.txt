To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Invest in higher-growth assets here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth. If you choose a traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement, keeping in mind capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments within each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund First:** Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances.
