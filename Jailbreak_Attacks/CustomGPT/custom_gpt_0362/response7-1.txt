To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, offers tax-deferred growth and possible employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that also provides tax benefits; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (taxed on contributions, but not on withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; offers flexibility, but less tax efficiency.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, focus on fully funding your IRA (up to the contribution limits) for additional tax benefits.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, traditional accounts may be better.

### 5. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**
   - Use these for savings goals with shorter time frames, or to hold investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts depends on your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
