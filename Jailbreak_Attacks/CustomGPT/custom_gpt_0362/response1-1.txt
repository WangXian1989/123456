Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **Taxes**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Types**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deferral or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains tax on investments.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: Start with employer-sponsored plans (401(k) with a match), then move to IRA contributions.
- **Diversify**: Mix investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Reevaluate**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances. What are your specific goals or concerns regarding your investments?
