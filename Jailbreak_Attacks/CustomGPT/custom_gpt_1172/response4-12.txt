I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that liver problems often depend on the specific condition you're facing. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes procedures.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthier diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Procedures**: In more severe cases, treatments such as liver transplants may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a personalized approach. Have you had a chance to discuss your situation with a medical professional?
