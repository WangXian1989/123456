Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maxing it out, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Put investments that generate high taxes (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxation.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower long-term capital gains (like growth stocks).

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - If you need liquidity in the near term, keep a portion in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversity and Asset Allocation:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across accounts, considering risk tolerance. Stocks can be in taxable accounts for potential long-term growth, while bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Conclusion
A tailored strategy considering your financial situation, goals, and tax implications will yield the best results. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific account type or investment strategy?
