Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limits are higher here than in IRAs, and contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: These accounts provide tax advantages, but they have different implications. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can invest with fewer restrictions on withdrawals and no contribution limits. However, youâ€™ll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. This account can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds sooner.

### General Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Balance contributions between traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.
