I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Generally, treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition you're facing, but they might include lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may also be prescribed, depending on the underlying cause, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune diseases.

In some cases, more severe conditions might necessitate procedures like a liver biopsy or, in extreme cases, a liver transplant. Your doctor will customize the treatment based on your specific diagnosis and needs, so make sure to have an open discussion about your symptoms and health history.
