Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) for contributions, with tax-free growth until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or liquidity, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing in retirement. Generally, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first for flexibility, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth IRAs to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your life circumstances change, such as getting a raise, having children, or approaching retirement.
