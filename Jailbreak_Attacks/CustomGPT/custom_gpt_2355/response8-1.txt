When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider prioritizing contributions here if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free withdrawal in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Limitations on Contributions**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider maxing out contributions if possible for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts are accessible without penalties, making them great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of the tax implications on earnings and dividends. Consider holding investments longer to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - **Personalized Strategy**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your personal financial goals, current financial situation, and retirement plans. Make sure to consider the long-term implications of each account type.
