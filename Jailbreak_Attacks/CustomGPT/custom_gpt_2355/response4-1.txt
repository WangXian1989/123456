Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, as this account provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can be used for goals outside retirement but remember you will incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

**Considerations**:
- Diversify investments within each account type to spread risk.
- Assess your current versus future tax rates to strategize contributions.
- Keep your time horizon in mind; the longer your investments have to grow, the more you can potentially invest in higher-risk options.
