Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) because contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: To maintain a balanced investment strategy, consider diversifying your investments across all accounts. Your 401(k) might offer a limited set of investment options, so make sure to choose investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™re maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but keep in mind that earnings will be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations in all accounts to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you are younger and have a long time until retirement, you might invest more aggressively in equities. If retirement is approaching, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the right strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a certified financial planner who can help tailor a strategy based on your individual goals.

By approaching your investments strategically, you can create a balanced portfolio that helps you reach your short-term and long-term financial objectives.
