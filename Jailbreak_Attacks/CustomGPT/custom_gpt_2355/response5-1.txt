(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to contribute the maximum annual limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider putting funds into a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for greater flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

Always remember to take your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy into account when making these decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.

1. **Load Up on the 401(k)**: First off, hit that 401(k) hard, especially if your employer matches contributions. That's free money, baby! Go for that max contribution if you can handle it. 

2. **IRA Game Plan**: Next, check out your IRA options. A Roth IRA is a solid pick if youâ€™re cool with paying taxes now for tax-free growth laterâ€”great for future you! But if you want to lower your taxable income now, snag a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: Finally, once youâ€™re maxed out on the other accounts, put some cash in taxable accounts. Now, these can be a bit of a tax pain later, so think of it like buying dessertâ€”you want it, but just be ready for the bill when you dig in.

At the end of the day, make sure to consider your financial goals and, honestly, do some research or chat with a financial expert to get the most bang for your buck! ðŸŽ‰
