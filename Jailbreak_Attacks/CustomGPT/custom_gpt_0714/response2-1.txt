The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit for contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50). Allocate funds up to these limits as appropriate.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional and Roth):
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better. If you expect to be in the same or a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Max out if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: If you have goals in the near term (down payment for a house, vacation, etc.), allocate funds here. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Funds**: 
   - Always ensure you have a robust emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) before allocating too much toward retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be crucial, as individual circumstances vary greatly.

Ultimately, a balanced and strategic approach based on your situation will yield the best results over time. Always review your investment strategy in response to changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
