To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize your contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax benefits. For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): Up to $19,500 (or $26,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: Up to $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) & IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don't provide tax advantages, they can offer greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds and real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (like growth stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversify Within Accounts**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Continually assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about setting up your distributions or managing your investments, seeking advice from a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for better growth and tax efficiency.
