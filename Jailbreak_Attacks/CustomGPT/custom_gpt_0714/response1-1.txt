The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax considerations. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have leftover funds after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts. Adjust the asset allocation based on the time horizon and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each account type during retirement, as this will affect your long-term financial health.

Lastly, consulting with a financial advisor could help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
