Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing money elsewhere.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Good for high-income earners due to tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan early how you will withdraw funds; typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to let retirement accounts grow.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
