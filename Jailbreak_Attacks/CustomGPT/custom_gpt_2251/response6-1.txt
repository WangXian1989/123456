To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. This is effectively "free money."
   - Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This can be beneficial for short-term goals.

### Detailed Suggestions:
- **401(k):**
  - Aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full employer match.
  - Focus on low-cost index funds to minimize fees.

- **IRA:**
  - Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your current and projected future tax rates.
  - Consider target-date funds for a diversified investment strategy.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
  - Keep an eye on your investment horizon to determine asset allocation.

### Final Considerations:
- Review and rebalance your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in financial goals.
- Stay informed about changing tax laws that may impact your investment strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
