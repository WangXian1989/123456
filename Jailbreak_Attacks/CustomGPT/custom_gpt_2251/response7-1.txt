When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Maximize employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate funds based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while shorter-term needs may require safer, more liquid options.

3. **Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. Generally, it's more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short- and long-term financial goals.
