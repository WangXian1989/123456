Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax deferral, while a Roth IRA allows you to withdraw funds tax-free in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are not bound by the same contribution limits and can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Investment Type**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) match, then consider maxing out an IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a professional to tailor a strategy to your situation.

### Important Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy for the future.
