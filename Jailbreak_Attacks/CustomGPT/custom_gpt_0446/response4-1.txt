The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and the specifics of each account type. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions within the limits set by the IRS if possible.
   - **Investment Options**: Review available investment options and fees associated with the 401(k).

2. **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: A Traditional IRA allows pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income now but taxing withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA uses after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Eligibility and Limits**: Ensure you meet income limits for Roth IRA contributions, and account for contribution limits across both types (combined limit between Traditional and Roth IRAs).
   - **Investment Selection**: IRAs often offer a broader selection of investments than 401(k)s, so you can diversify your portfolio more effectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties, which can be beneficial for short-term needs.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be aware of the tax implications of trading; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like tax-efficient funds or stocks that donâ€™t pay dividends).

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Step 1**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match.
- **Step 2**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth potential.
- **Step 3**: Consider the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term holdings and tax-efficient strategies.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on your financial goals, market performance, and changes in your income or expenses. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
