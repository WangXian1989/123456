Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can help reduce your current taxable income. Traditional accounts grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these donâ€™t offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility (e.g., accessing funds without penalties) and potential capital gains tax benefits on long-term investments.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'd want to withdraw from taxable accounts first for tax-efficient income, followed by tax-deferred accounts and lastly Roth accounts, which can grow tax-free for a longer period.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

Make sure to adjust your strategy as your financial circumstances, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.
