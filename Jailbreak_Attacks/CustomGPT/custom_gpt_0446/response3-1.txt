When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to at least receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you meet the income eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax advantages that can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions (up to the limit), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These are less restrictive than retirement accounts and allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. Focus on a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consider Taxes:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure about the specifics of your situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach allows you to take advantage of the benefits offered by each account type while staying aligned with your long-term financial goals.
