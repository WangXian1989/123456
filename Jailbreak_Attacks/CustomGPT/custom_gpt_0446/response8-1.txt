When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind a few key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) Plans**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRAs**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, similar to 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains realized on investments in these accounts are taxed when sold. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here for better tax treatment.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has its own contribution limits, so maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if your employer offers matching) and IRAs (if eligible).

3. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - For long-term goals, higher-risk investments might be appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA).
   - For short-term goals, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Before retirement, think about how you'll access funds:
   - Utilize the taxable account first for short-term needs to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - Plan when to tap into your 401(k) or IRAs based on your tax situation in retirement.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Your personal risk tolerance will also influence where to allocate your funds. Generally, higher-risk investments are suitable for accounts with a longer time horizon.

6. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring that you are not overly invested in any one asset class.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
