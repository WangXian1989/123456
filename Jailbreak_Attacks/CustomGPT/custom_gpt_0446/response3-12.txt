I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for liver problems. Treatment typically depends on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Generally, options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures or surgery. Please speak with a doctor for guidance tailored to your situation.
