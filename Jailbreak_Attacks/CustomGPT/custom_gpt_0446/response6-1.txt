To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if your income allows. If not, a traditional IRA might be beneficial.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Avoid holding high-turnover funds or bonds in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for assets with higher growth potential.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity, keeping lower-growth investments here.

### 4. **Strategize Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize tax impacts, potentially taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts more time to grow.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Additional Tips:
- **Consider Fees**: Pay attention to the fees associated with each account type.
- **Investment Choices**: Different accounts may offer different investment optionsâ€”choose wisely based on your strategy.

This balanced approach optimizes your investments while considering tax implications and liquidity needs.
