Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you pay taxes on investment gains in these accounts, they also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Balance your risk based on your age and retirement horizon. Younger individuals can typically take more risk with stocks, while those closer to retirement might want more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and life changes.

In general, a mix that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth, complemented by taxable accounts for liquidity, often works well. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
