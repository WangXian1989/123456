Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are fully taxable, but offer flexibility and can be beneficial for investment strategies.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Once you receive the full match from your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions (for 2024, up to $6,500 or $7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Allocate Funds Based on Goals**:
   - Long-term growth: Focus on your 401(k) and IRAs for tax-advantaged growth.
   - Short-term needs: Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized guidance can optimize your strategy and adapt to your unique situation.

By following this structure, you can effectively manage your investments to maximize growth while minimizing your tax burden.
