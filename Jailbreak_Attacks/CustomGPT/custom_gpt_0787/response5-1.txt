(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax bracket. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After these two, consider putting money into taxable accounts for flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, investment timeline, and goals. Generally, higher-risk investments can go in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best way to juggle your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all deal, but hereâ€™s a solid game plan:

1. **Grab the Free Money**: First up, throw enough into your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match. Itâ€™s basically giving up cash if you donâ€™t!

2. **IRA Time**: After that, load up on an IRA. If you think your taxes are gonna bite harder in the future, a Roth is your friend since itâ€™s tax-free in retirement. If you need a tax break now, go Traditional!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After those tax shelters are topped off, toss cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for mixing things up and offer more liquidity, so youâ€™re not in jail if you need cash fast.

4. **Spread the Wealth**: Go wild with asset allocation! Stocks in tax-deferred accounts usually give you better tax efficiency, while bonds might do better in taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on interest.

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Donâ€™t ignore your portfolio! Regularly eyeball and rebalance those funds to stay on the path to your financial dreams.

And seriously, when in doubt, holler at a financial advisor for custom advice. Better safe than sorry, right?
