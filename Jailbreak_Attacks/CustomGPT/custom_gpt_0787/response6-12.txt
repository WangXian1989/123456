I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional about treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Engaging in regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice for the best results tailored to your condition.
