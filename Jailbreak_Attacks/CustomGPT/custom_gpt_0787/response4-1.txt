To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, taking into account tax implications, contribution limits, and your financial goals:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if there's an employer match. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) (or if you have already hit the annual limit), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider what investments are held in each type of account:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments**, such as bonds or actively traded stocks, should generally be kept in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments**, like index funds and ETFs, can be placed in taxable accounts since they generate less taxable income.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account type to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow).

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances, considering factors like your age, income level, and retirement goals.
