Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment mix is diversified based on your risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and different asset classes can help manage risk.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to build your savings consistently over time.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust based on market conditions or life changes.

It's essential to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances, possibly consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
