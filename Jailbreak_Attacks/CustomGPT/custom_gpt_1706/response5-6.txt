1. **Hit Them on Social Media**: Young folks are glued to TikTok and Instagram! Create hilarious memes or creative videos that catch their eye. If you can make them laugh or think, you're halfway there. Authenticity is key; donâ€™t be that old person trying to use slang.

2. **Focus on What Matters**: These voters care deeply about real issues like climate change, education affordability, and social justice. If your message resonates with their passions, theyâ€™re more likely to pay attentionâ€”so don't be afraid to get a bit passionate yourself!
