To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider maximizing your contribution limits here if you have high income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions but tax the withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, so use them for investments that may generate lower tax burdens (such as index funds or tax-efficient funds).

3. **Retirement Goals**: Align your contributions with your retirement timeline. Focus on tax-advantaged accounts if you are far from retirement, as they will help grow your investments tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term, tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those generating taxable income, since you might not pay taxes on capital gains if you're not selling.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Annual Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation changes and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider getting personalized advice from a professional who can assess your individual situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded strategy for distributing your money that optimizes your tax advantages and aligns with your retirement goals.
