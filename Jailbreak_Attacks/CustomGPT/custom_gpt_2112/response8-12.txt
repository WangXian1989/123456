I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver problems and treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some potential treatment strategies depending on the liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and support liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Medications for Fatty Liver Disease**: Some medications might be prescribed to reduce fat in the liver or manage associated conditions like diabetes.

3. **Monitoring and Lifestyle Management**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and overall health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases or when thereâ€™s liver damage (like cirrhosis), a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some people consider milk thistle or other supplements, though you should discuss these with your doctor first.

Discussing your specific symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
