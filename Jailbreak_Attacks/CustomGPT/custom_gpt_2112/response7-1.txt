Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each option and a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment choices and potential penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Strategy**: Max out your contributions to get the employer match, then contribute further based on your financial capacity.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types**: Traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (tax-free growth).
   - **Pros/Cons**:
     - *Traditional*: Tax-deductible contributions, but taxes apply upon withdrawal.
     - *Roth*: No tax on withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax income.
   - **Strategy**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If not, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility for withdrawals at any time and a wider array of investment options.
   - **Cons**: Taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains can diminish returns.
   - **Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for goals with shorter time frames or for investments that generate capital gains, as the tax on long-term gains is lower than ordinary income.

### **Overall Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before investing.
2. **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match in your 401(k).
3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA. 
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investing after maximizing tax-advantaged options.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (up to the match).
- **IRA**: $6,500 for each individual (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of your investment budget.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
