Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Deferred Growth**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both accounts allow for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions after meeting your employer match in your 401(k). For 2024, the contribution limits are $20,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Consider the investment options available in each account. A diversified portfolio can help manage risk:
     - **401(k)**: Often limited to specific funds. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
     - **IRA**: More diverse investment options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs). Take advantage of this by building a broader asset allocation.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term savings or investments that may result in capital gains, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Current and Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Taxable accounts may have lower tax implications on long-term capital gains than withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Life Stage and Risk Tolerance**
   - Young investors might skew heavily towards stocks in retirement accounts for growth, while those closer to retirement may want to prioritize bonds for stability.

### 6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term expenses. 

### Example Strategy:
1. **Contribute to 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Max out IRA** contributions.
3. **Resume 401(k)** contributions until limit is reached.
4. **Invest additional funds** in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review
- Annually review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.
