Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
   - **Pre-tax benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you want tax savings now, a Traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Contribution limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and make sure to max out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals, as they allow for easier withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax-efficient investing**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable events, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Steps:
- **Prioritize**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) to get the match, then fund an IRA, followed by taxable accounts.
- **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually or after significant life changes.

### Consult a Professional:
Ultimately, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances. They can provide insights based on your overall financial picture and goals.
