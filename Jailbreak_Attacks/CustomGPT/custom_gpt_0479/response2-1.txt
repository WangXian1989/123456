Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**
   - **Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match**, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRS Limits**: Each account type has contribution limits. Maximize contributions to your pre-tax accounts first (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Growth Potential**: High-growth investments (like stocks) might be better in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, emphasize Roth accounts. If you expect a lower tax bracket, focus on tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Balance and Rebalance**
   - **Regular Review**: Monitor your portfolio allocation across accounts and adjust as needed based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### 6. **Target Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (like saving for a home) and tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings (like retirement).

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized recommendations tailored to your financial situation, consider seeking advice from a financial planner.

By taking these factors into account, you can develop a strategy that optimally distributes your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
