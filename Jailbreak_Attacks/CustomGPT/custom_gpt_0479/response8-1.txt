To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** (Traditional and Roth) offer tax benefits. Prioritize these accounts for retirement savings over taxable accounts.
   - Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to these accounts if possible.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Withdrawals Consideration:**
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, balance between taxable accounts and tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategy to offset capital gains in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and account balances, and adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and market conditions.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k):** 30-50%
- **IRA:** 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20-30%

Adjust percentages based on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance.
