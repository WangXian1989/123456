To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, which offer tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) to take full advantage of tax deferral.

3. **Determine Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, considering that withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Roth or Traditional, balance your investments accordingly, typically with a mix of stocks and bonds fitting your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are often taxed at lower rates. Avoid high-yield bonds or frequent trading in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, think about the order of withdrawals:
   - Take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal situations vary widely, and an advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.

Keep in mind your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial situation while making these decisions.
