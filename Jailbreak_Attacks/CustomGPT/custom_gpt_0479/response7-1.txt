Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### Factors to Consider:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax-deferred benefits apply to Traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs, however, offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income in these accounts is subject to capital gains taxes and ordinary income tax, depending on your investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. In 2024, for example, the limits may differ (check for the latest updates).

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an accessible cash reserve for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your portfolio periodically and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that takes into account your complete financial situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering taxes and investment strategies, you can work towards a robust financial future.
