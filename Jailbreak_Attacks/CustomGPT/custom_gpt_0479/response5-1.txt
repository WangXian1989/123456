(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can add funds to taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility, although they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding how much to allocate to each type of account. 

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down like a financial guru on caffeine! Hereâ€™s the hot take:

1. **401(k) First, Baby!**: Get that employer match ASAP. Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushionsâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Contribute enough to max that out.

2. **IRA Lovinâ€™**: Next up, slide into those IRAs (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are the bomb if you think your tax rate will be higher in the future. Itâ€™s like planting a money tree that grows tax-free fruit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: After loading up on the sweet tax-advantaged goodies, hit up your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like your flexible friendâ€”you can access them anytime (just be ready to pay those capital gains taxes when you withdraw).

4. **Play the Tax Game**: Keep an eye on those tax brackets. If youâ€™re killing it this year and in a higher bracket, prioritize pre-tax accounts like the Traditional IRA. If youâ€™re taking a hit, go Roth, and make that tax-free money work for you!

5. **Diversify Like a Pro**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Mix it up with stocks, bonds, and whatever else floats your boat across all accounts. Your future self will thank you! 

So, remember, it's all about playing the long game and having fun with your funds! ðŸ’¸
