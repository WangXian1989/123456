I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on liver health. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage liver conditions.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect issues early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, such as certain medications and environmental toxins, is crucial.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver failure, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
