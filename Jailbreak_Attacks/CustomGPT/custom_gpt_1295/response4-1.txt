Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA has tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You might invest more aggressively in a 401(k) or IRA, given their long-term nature.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances by consulting with a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax benefits while keeping your long-term goals in mind.
