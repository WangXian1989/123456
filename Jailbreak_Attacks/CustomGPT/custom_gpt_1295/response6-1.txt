Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement vs. Short-term Needs**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth, using taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how each account is taxed. Traditional accounts may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth accounts can provide tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible. A traditional or Roth IRA can diversify your tax exposure in retirement.

### 3. Evaluate Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Often has a limited selection of investment options; choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **IRA**: Typically offers a wider range of investment choices; consider diversifying across asset classes.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- **Regular Check-ins**: Monitor the performance and asset allocation of each account, adjusting as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

### Conclusion
Balancing between these accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
