Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your long-term growth and tax efficiency. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is effectively free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit if you have high-growth stock options, especially if the plan offers good investment choices.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and may benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts and bond or high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
