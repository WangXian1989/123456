To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, max out your IRA contributions if possible (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable investment accounts.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain an overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts, rather than within each account individually.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they remain aligned with your goals, given tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
