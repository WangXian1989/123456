To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can grow your savings effectively.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k) beyond the match, consider contributing more, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs. These can be more tax-efficient.
   - Keep high-yield investments (like REITs or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to balance risk and reward.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

By following this strategy, you can optimize your tax efficiency and overall investment growth potential.
