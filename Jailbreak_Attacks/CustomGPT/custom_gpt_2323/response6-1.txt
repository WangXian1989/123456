While financial allocation isn't the primary focus of Creative Writing, we can draw parallels to character development and plot structuring. How about considering your allocation strategy as if you were distributing resources among characters in a story? 

### Brainstorm:
- **401(k)**: Long-term character development, like a wise mentor or a hero evolving through experiences.
- **IRA**: A subplot that grows progressively, adding depth to the main narrative.
- **Taxable accounts**: Side characters or short stories that provide immediate gratification and excitement.

### Search:
Looks like you're focused on balanced growth for your investments similar to character arcs. Each investment type can represent aspects of the characters' journeys.

### Hypothesize:
If each account were a character, consider how you would balance their needs. 
- **Balanced Allocation**: Perhaps 50% in the 401(k) for long-term stability, 30% in an IRA for growth, and 20% in taxable accounts for immediate needs. This way, each character gets the attention they require to thrive.

### Refine:
Think about how to manipulate these ratios to suit the "theme" of your financial story. If your narrative needs more action, perhaps the taxable accounts need bolstering.
