(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, especially if there's a match, as this is essentially "free money." Follow this by contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth. After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access to your money. Itâ€™s helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Just keep an eye on those taxesâ€”you donâ€™t wanna be caught off guard. And hey, it never hurts to chat with a financial planner for some pro tips!
