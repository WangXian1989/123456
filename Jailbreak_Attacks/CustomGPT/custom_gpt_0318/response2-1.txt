To effectively distribute your money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can reduce your taxable income now or in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available within your 401(k) plan.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Determine whether a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals) aligns with your retirement strategy.
   - **Contribute Regularly**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Diversify Investments**: Utilize the wide range of investment options in an IRA for diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the impact of capital gains taxes on your investment strategy. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, that generate less taxable income.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling investments that have lost value.

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Tailor the asset mix based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - **Regular Review**: Continually review and adjust your allocation based on your evolving financial situation and market conditions.

Ultimately, the right balance depends on your individual financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Happy investing!
