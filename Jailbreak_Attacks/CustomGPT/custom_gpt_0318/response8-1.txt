Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Employer match (if available).
     - Tax-deferred growth.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Best For:**
     - Contributing up to the employer match to leverage free money.
     - Investing for long-term growth given the tax-advantage.
   
### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - Contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - Tax-deferred growth; pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; tax-free growth.
     - Tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Best For:**
     - Depending on your tax bracket, using Traditional IRA for tax deduction now, or Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Flexibility in withdrawals; no penalties or restrictions.
     - Lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.
   - **Best For:**
     - Short-term goals or needs.
     - Strategies involving tax-loss harvesting.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you're getting the full employer match in your 401(k).
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) might be beneficial.
3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a mix of tax-deferred, after-tax, and taxable funds for flexibility in retirement withdrawals.
4. **Investment Balance**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio (across all accounts) aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
5. **Adjust Contribution Levels**: As your financial situation changes, revisit and adjust the money distribution to reflect current goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Given the complexities of tax implications and personal financial goals, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy unique to your situation.
