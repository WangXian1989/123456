Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and aim to reach the contribution limit for the year if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged options. These accounts provide flexibility, though you’ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust the asset allocation among the accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about how withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs are tax-free.

8. **Keep Emergency Funds Separate**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals which might incur penalties.

9. **Consult Financial Advisors**: It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can optimize your investment growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
