The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options and potential tax advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you still have the capacity to contribute more after maxing out the IRA, continue funding your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This allows for higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. While these do not offer the same tax benefits, they provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from different accounts. For instance, withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified to minimize risk. Different accounts may be allocated differently based on tax considerations.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review your financial plans and asset allocations to ensure they align with changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your unique circumstances and strategies.
