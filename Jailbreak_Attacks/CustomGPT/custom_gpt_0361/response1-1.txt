When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a few key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that before putting money into other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: IRAs and 401(k)s typically offer tax advantages. Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts (up to legal limits) before funding taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a higher tax bracket, focusing on tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect your income to increase, a Roth IRA could be a better option, as withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement.

4. **Investment Horizon and Accessibility**: If you need to access funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts as they offer more liquidity. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodic review and rebalancing ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals over time.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a customized plan based on your individual circumstances!
