To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts typically provide tax deductions or tax-deferred growth, which can enhance your returns over time.

3. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Goals and Timeline**: Consider your financial goals and time horizon. For long-term goals, like retirement, focus more on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility, but withdrawals can impact your tax bracket.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts; consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

Make sure to align your strategy with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
