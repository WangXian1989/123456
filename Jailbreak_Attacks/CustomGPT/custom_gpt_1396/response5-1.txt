(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if youâ€™re looking for tax advantages.
  
2. **IRA**: If eligible, traditional or Roth IRAs can offer tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals and allow for different investment strategies.

It's wise to balance your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon while periodically rebalancing your portfolio.

First off, slam as much as you can into your **401(k)** to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Next, dump more into an **IRA**. If youâ€™re feeling the Roth vibe, go for it! Tax-free growth is the name of the game for your future self. 

Once youâ€™ve stuffed those two, turn to your **taxable accounts**. These are your playground! You can buy and sell with fewer restrictions and can cash out when you need. Plus, with smart strategies like tax-loss harvesting, you can actually minimize your tax bill. Just remember, spread your investments across different assets and keep it all balanced. Now go make that money work for you! ðŸ’¸
