Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first—it's essentially free money.
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) if it has low fees and good investment options.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deductible contributions based on your income and other factors.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Considerations**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed.
