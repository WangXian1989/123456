Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic move that depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation) to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Tax Diversification**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you want to access before retirement age, as they offer more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Place riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Bonds**: Consider placing bonds in taxable accounts, as their interest income may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate compared to ordinary income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impacts and extend the longevity of your accounts.

By assessing these factors, you can create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing your tax strategy.
