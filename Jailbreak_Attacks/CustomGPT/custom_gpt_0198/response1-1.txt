To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies and factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is taxed in the year it is earned, which might lead to a higher tax bill compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** If your goal is retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts with the option of Roth accounts for tax-free growth.
   - **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:** Allocate some funds to a taxable account for quick access without penalties if you need cash quickly.

### 3. **Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments in each account for risk management. This means balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 5. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For example, 401(k) and IRA contributions have annual caps, so plan accordingly.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, plan how you'll withdraw from each account type. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### Example Allocation Strategy: 
- **Max out 401(k) contributions up to the company match.**
- **Then, contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.**
- **Next, invest in your Traditional IRA or additional funds in your 401(k) if possible.**
- **Finally, allocate any further savings into your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.**

### Pros and Cons:
| **Account Type** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| **401(k)**       | Tax-deferred growth, employer match | Limited investment choices, penalties for early withdrawal |
| **IRA**          | Tax benefits, various investment options | Contribution limits, penalties for early withdrawal in Traditional IRA |
| **Taxable Account** | Flexibility, no contribution limits | Tax on income, less growth potential compared to tax-advantaged accounts |

### Conclusion:
The best distribution varies by individual circumstances, including age, income, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
