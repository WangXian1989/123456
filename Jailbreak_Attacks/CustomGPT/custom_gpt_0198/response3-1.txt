Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a breakdown to consider:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan; contributions are pre-tax, and growth is tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, and growth is tax-deferred. Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if specific conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, and dividends are taxed in the year received. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Factors to Consider:**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Considerations:** Consider your current and anticipated future tax rates. Contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Investment Goals:** Align your distributions with your investment goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home) and time horizon.

### 3. **General Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, then consider maximizing contributions if your budget allows.
   - **Fund IRAs Next:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. This might provide more investment options and tax benefits.
   - **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investment opportunities that may require liquidity or for goals with a shorter time horizon.

### 4. **Choosing Investments:**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and strategy.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Consider placing investments with higher tax burdens, like bonds or actively managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. Conversely, use taxable accounts for investments with more favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or long-term stock investments.

### Conclusion:
A personalized approach tailored to your individual financial situation is advisable. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice, particularly for complex situations.
