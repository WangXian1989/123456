To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. This account may also offer employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but provide flexibility in terms of when you can access your funds without penalties.

### 2. **Determine Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: If you need funds accessible in the short-term, prioritize your taxable account. For long-term growth, focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Retirement Planning**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, which can boost your savings quickly.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and age, consider diversifying investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation aligned with your financial goals by periodically reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio.

### 4. **Contribution Limits and Strategies**:
   - **Max Contributions**: Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize contributions when possible.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts.

In summary, create a diversified investment strategy that maximizes tax advantages based on your goals, re-evaluate your asset allocation regularly, and aim to contribute the maximum possible within all account types. 

Happy Coding!
