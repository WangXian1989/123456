Great question! Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines along with the pros and cons of each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which can significantly boost your savings.
     - Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options compared to an IRA.
     - Early withdrawals may incur penalties.

### 2. **Traditional IRA**
   - **Pros:**
     - Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income for the year.
     - Tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k).
     - More investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
     - Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and early withdrawals may incur penalties.

### 3. **Roth IRA**
   - **Pros:**
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
     - No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during your lifetime.
     - Contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty.
   - **Cons:**
     - Income limits can restrict eligibility.
     - Contributions are capped at lower amounts compared to 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
     - You can invest in a wide variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
     - Capital gains are taxed at favorable rates compared to ordinary income when held for more than a year.
   - **Cons:**
     - Youâ€™ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.
     - No tax advantages for contributions.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Max Out Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match first. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions.
   
2. **Tax Considerations:** Depending on your current tax bracket, you may prefer a Traditional IRA (if you need a tax deduction now) or a Roth IRA (if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
   
3. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals:**
   - Retirement accounts can be geared toward long-term growth, focusing on equities.
   - Taxable accounts may contain more conservative investments or those with high turnover, due to the tax implications.

4. **Rebalance as Needed:** Regularly review your investment to ensure you are on track with your goals and adjust your allocations if necessary.
