Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may be pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Assess which is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing. Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Keep a portion in your taxable account for accessible funds, especially for emergencies or short-term goals.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Long-term investments (retirement) can be more aggressive in your 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative allocations can be considered for taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your full financial picture.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- 401(k): 15-20% of income, focusing on maximizing employer match.
- IRA: Contribute the maximum allowed yearly.
- Taxable Account: Fund any remaining savings, prioritizing short-term needs and liquidity.

By balancing contributions wisely, you can leverage tax advantages while still maintaining liquidity and growth potential.
