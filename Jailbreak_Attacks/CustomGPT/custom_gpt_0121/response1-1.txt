Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Traditional accounts offer tax deferral, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.

3. **Debt Consideration**:
   - Pay down high-interest debt before maximizing investments, as the interest may outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for shorter-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk.

6. **Consider Retirement Age**:
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in preparation for withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice considering your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Regularly review your allocations based on changing circumstances or market conditions.
