Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments that may have lower tax implications, such as index funds or investments you don't plan to sell for a long time.

### 4. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**
   - Choose investments aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Tax-advantaged accounts can hold more growth-oriented investments, while taxable accounts may suit more liquid assets.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

Adjust percentages based on personal circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice is also beneficial.
