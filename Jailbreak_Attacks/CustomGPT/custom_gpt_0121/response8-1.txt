To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In your taxable account, consider using more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

4. **Minimize Taxes:**
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of investment income, appreciating investments, and distributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help you consider your specific goals, risk appetite, and financial situation.

By employing these strategies, you can better manage your investments and minimize your tax burden over time.
