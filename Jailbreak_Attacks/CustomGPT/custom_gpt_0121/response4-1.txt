To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax benefits now.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts where you can defer taxes (401(k) and IRA). Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Offset gains with losses if possible.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your target allocation and risk profile.
