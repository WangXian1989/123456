To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start with contributions here, especially if your employer matches a percentage.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, focusing on tax benefits that suit your long-term goals.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This way, you minimize tax liabilities on interest and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are best for long-term investments due to tax advantages. Consider investing in stocks or growth-focused mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments based on performance and changing goals, ensuring you maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for the best order of withdrawals during retirement to minimize taxes.
