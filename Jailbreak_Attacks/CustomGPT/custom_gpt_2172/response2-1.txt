The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money and a guaranteed return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts:**  
   If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:**  
   After maximizing any employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k). This is especially beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket since contributions are made pre-tax.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**  
   Consider setting aside money in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Investments in taxable accounts also allow for greater flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts:**  
   Diversify your investments across these accounts, focusing on asset allocation strategies. Equities may perform well over the long term and should be included, but consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments suitable for your risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:**  
   Be mindful of the tax implications when investing. For example, holding high-growth stocks in a Roth IRA might be advantageous, while bonds, which generate interest income, may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund:**  
   Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, so you won’t have to withdraw from your retirement accounts in emergencies.

8. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**  
   Periodically assess your financial strategy and make adjustments as necessary based on your life stages, changing tax laws, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match, then maximize contributions to the IRS limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on income eligibility.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings for flexibility.
