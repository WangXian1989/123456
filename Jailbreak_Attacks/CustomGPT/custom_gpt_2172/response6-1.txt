The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Balance Your Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** After maximizing your match, consider contributing more if you have remaining capacity, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Once your 401(k) contributions meet your employer's match, evaluate if you can fully fund your IRA before returning to your 401(k).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term savings or investments where you might need liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable:** Consider holding investments that generate income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and assets with little dividend payout (like growth stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Your risk tolerance should guide your asset allocation. More aggressive investments may belong in tax-advantaged accounts, allowing for growth without immediate tax impact.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you're diversifying across asset classes in all accounts, adjusting for your overall portfolio.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Periodically:**
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly assess your accounts and allocation strategy as life circumstances, tax laws, and market conditions change.
   - **Rebalance as Needed:** If one account becomes significantly larger due to market performance, rebalance to maintain your desired allocation.

By considering these factors, you can strategically distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
