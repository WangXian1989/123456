Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as they allow your money to grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they offer flexibility and no contribution limits, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all your accounts to help manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your potential withdrawal strategy. For example, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have a suitable emergency fund in a readily accessible account.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes.
