Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly impact your long-term financial health. Here are several factors to consider when deciding how to allocate your investments:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes on that money until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are due on withdrawals during retirement. In contrast, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Evaluate your current vs. expected future tax rates to decide between them.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates and tax-loss harvesting strategies.

2. **Retirement Goals:**
   - Consider your expected timeline for retirement. The closer you are to retirement, the less risk you may want to take on, whereas younger investors can typically afford to take more risks with growth investments.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk—balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - If you’re in your peak earning years, tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA may be prioritized to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Strategically withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) in conjunction with withdrawals from taxable accounts can help manage your tax liability during retirement.

5. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you’re over age 50), and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you’re over age 50).

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account.

7. **Consulting a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider getting advice from a financial planner to tailor a plan based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and investment timeline. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your financial plans.
