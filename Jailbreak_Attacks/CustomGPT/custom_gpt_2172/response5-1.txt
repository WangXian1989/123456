(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it's generally advisable to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider factors like fees and investment options. 

2. **IRA**: Contributing to an IRA can provide tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals under certain conditions. Assess your income level and tax situation to determine what type of IRA is best for you.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you have maxed out retirement accounts. Keep in mind that any gains are subject to taxes, so you'll want to plan your investment strategies accordingly. 

Balancing contributions based on these factors while considering your overall investment strategy can help you effectively distribute your money.
