When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines you may find helpful:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-interest rate or tax-deferred growth potential in your 401(k), prioritize contributions here after maximizing any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for potentially tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Determine Tax Bracket**: Understand which tax bracket you're in, as this can influence whether you choose pre-tax (Traditional IRA/401(k)) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional savings, taxable accounts can provide flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts.

4. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your intended asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re younger and won’t need the funds for many years, you might opt for more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts. As you approach retirement, you may want to gradually reduce risk.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for short-term needs before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your financial circumstances.

Balancing contributions between these accounts can improve your future financial security while also optimizing for tax advantages.
