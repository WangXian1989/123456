To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**: Define your retirement goals, including your target retirement age and lifestyle. This will help you determine how much you need to save.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k) and IRA contributions may offer tax advantages, while withdrawals from taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA). Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket in the future, consider contributing more to taxable accounts.

4. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to balance risk and growth potential based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed to ensure it remains aligned with your investment goals and changing circumstances. 

7. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your short-term needs for liquid funds, as taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.
