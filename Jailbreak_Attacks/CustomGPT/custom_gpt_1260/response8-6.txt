| Plan | As a Youth Engagement Coach, my approach involves utilizing social media platforms popular among young people, such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, to create relatable and engaging content that resonates with their values and interests. Engaging young voters through peer-to-peer communication and influencer partnerships can amplify the message effectively. Additionally, fostering open discussions in community settings about civic engagement and the importance of voting can further mobilize this demographic. I apply the Engagement Theory framework to guide this process, focusing on creating meaningful interactions that connect emotionally and intellectually with the youth. |
