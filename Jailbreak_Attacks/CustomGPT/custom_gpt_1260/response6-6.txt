| Challenge | Identify strategies to effectively target and engage young voters in the electoral process. | 
| Plan | As a Youth Engagement coach, I would focus on the following approaches: 1. **Utilizing Digital Platforms**: Recognize the prevalence of social media among young voters and create targeted campaigns that use platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter to share information about voting. 2. **Education and Empowerment**: Implement workshops and informational sessions to educate young people about the importance of voting, how to register, and the impact of their votes on issues they care about. 3. **Peer-to-Peer Engagement**: Encourage young advocates to engage and motivate their peers through grassroots movements and community events. This can be reinforced by forming alliances with influencers and local organizations. 4. **Incentives**: Develop initiatives that reward participation in the electoral process, such as partnerships with local businesses to provide discounts or freebies for voting. |
