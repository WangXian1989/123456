To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess your financial goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement age, expected expenses, and risk tolerance.

2. **Understand account tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement after certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the timing of selling investments for tax efficiency.

3. **Allocation strategy**:
   - Max out contributions to employer-sponsored plans (like a 401(k)) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to IRAs to diversify tax treatment (traditional for tax deduction now, Roth for tax-free growth).
   - Use taxable accounts for other funds, investments, or short-term goals. Consider holding investments with higher capital gains for longer to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and individual investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Periodic review**: Regularly review your portfolio and make adjustments based on changes in tax laws, financial goals, or market conditions.
