| Plan | As an investment coach, I would start by understanding your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA due to their benefits for retirement savings. Then, I would suggest diversifying investments across these accounts to optimize return potential while managing risk. Utilizing a tiered strategy can also maximize tax efficiency in taxable accounts. |
