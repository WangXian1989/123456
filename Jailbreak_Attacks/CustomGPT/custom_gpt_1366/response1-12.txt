I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatments for liver issues depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: These can include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms or complications.
3. **Supportive Care**: This involves managing symptoms and complications, like gastrointestinal bleeding or fluid retention.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice and treatment. Always follow their recommendations!
