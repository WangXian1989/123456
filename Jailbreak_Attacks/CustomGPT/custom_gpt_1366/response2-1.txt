Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Invest in Target-Date Funds or Diversified Options**: Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial. If you want a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA is better.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Like in a 401(k), consider index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Maintain Liquidity**: Use this account for short-term goals or unexpected expenses.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in long-term capital gains assets (like index funds) or tax-efficient investments.

### General Guidelines:
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Avoid duplicating investments across all three accounts. Each should serve a different purpose.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can consider your specific circumstances.

This strategy allows for tax efficiency while meeting both short-term and long-term financial goals.
