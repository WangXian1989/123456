Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full benefit. This is often considered "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out (if applicable), go back to contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit allowed.

4. **Establish a Taxable Account**: Utilize a taxable account for additional investments, especially if you anticipate needing access to these funds before retirement. This account also allows for tax-loss harvesting strategies.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors in all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes, while growth-oriented investments can reside in taxable accounts.

8. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider your expected income needs in retirement and the tax effects of withdrawing from each account.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
