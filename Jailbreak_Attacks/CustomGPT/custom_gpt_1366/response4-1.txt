Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this for retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, this might be a better option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more access to your money without penalties, making them ideal for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize employer-sponsored plans**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match first.
- **Consider IRAs next**: Maximize contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Use taxable accounts for additional savings**: Any remaining funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions can be invested here for liquidity.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review your allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals. Adjust as needed to stay aligned with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
