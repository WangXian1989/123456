Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limits are higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After hitting these retirement accounts, direct any additional savings into a taxable investment account. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. For example, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income in retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your unique situation.

This method balances growth, tax efficiency, and access, setting you up for a more secure financial future.
