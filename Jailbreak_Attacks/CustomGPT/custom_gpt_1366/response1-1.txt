Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Investment Approach**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of mutual funds; choose low-cost index funds or diversified options.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs based on your risk profile.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like ETFs or index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA)**: Withdrawals taxed at your ordinary rate when you retire.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on dividends and capital gains yearly. Consider tax loss harvesting to offset gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment mix is diversified across accounts. This helps balance risk.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation.
