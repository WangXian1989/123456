To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to gain any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim to max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation) each year.

2. **Tax Diversification:**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Utilize your taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower taxes (like index funds) or tax-efficient strategies.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can benefit from compounding without annual taxes.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxable income better.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your expected tax situation in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow as long as possible.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider discussing with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency.
