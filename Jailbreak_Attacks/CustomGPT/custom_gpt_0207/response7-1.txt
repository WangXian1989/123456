To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: If you're looking for long-term growth, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold. Use these accounts for investments you may want to access sooner or for tax-efficient investments like index funds.

4. **Balance Contributions**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) or IRA contributions, then allocate excess funds to your taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.
