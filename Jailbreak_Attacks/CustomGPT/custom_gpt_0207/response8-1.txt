Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Options**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - Optimize for tax efficiency—favor lower-turnover investments.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit.
- **Max Out IRAs**: Contribute to an IRA after getting the full employer match.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once IRAs are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Asset Allocation:
- Diversify across account types—consider risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
