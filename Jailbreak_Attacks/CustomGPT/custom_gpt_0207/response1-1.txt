Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are flexible and can be used for short-term goals.

5. **Investment Types**: In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term investments, like stocks. Use taxable accounts for assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% (max out match)
- **IRA**: 20% (balance between Traditional and Roth)
- **Taxable**: 30% (for liquidity and flexibility)
