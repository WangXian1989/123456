Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. It offers tax-deferred growth and lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Consider your future tax bracket when deciding where to place your money.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

2. **Diversity of Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth investments, as itâ€™s difficult to access before retirement age.
   - In your IRA, consider a mix of conservative and aggressive investments based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term investments or those you might need to access sooner.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw money in retirement. Ideally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your unique financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to growing and managing your investments.
