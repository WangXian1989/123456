Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get the employer match first, if offered.
   - Maximize contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for shorter-term goals.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Balance between tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all account types to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
