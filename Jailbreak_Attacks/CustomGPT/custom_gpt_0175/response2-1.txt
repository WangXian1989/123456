Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing enough to maximize any employer match. This account has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible for tax deductions, it can be beneficial to contribute to a traditional IRA next. Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility and liquidity, as well as potential capital gains tax advantages on long-term holdings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from your accounts in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals, helping you develop a tailored strategy.

Each individual's situation is unique, so consider these guidelines and adjust them according to your own financial goals and needs.
