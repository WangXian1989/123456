The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your income, you might benefit from contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match and IRA contributions, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) if you haven’t already. 

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've funded your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These give you more flexibility in accessing your funds and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. Your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline should influence your asset allocation.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of which investments you hold in each account type. For instance, consider holding tax-inefficient investments like bonds in your 401(k) or IRA and tax-efficient investments like stocks in your taxable account.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance by rebalancing your portfolio periodically.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
