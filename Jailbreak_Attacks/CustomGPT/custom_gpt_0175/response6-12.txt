I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary significantly based on the specific condition. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.
   - Regular exercise and avoiding certain medications can also help.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
   - Supplements like vitamin E or other antioxidants might be suggested for fatty liver disease.

In any case, discussing your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider is essential for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
