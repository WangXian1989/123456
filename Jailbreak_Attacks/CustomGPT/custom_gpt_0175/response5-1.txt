(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, it may be advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first. 

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to maximize that match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider putting additional funds into an IRA, whether itâ€™s a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your income eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be directed towards taxable accounts. While these accounts donâ€™t offer the same tax advantages, they provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

Be sure to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

1. **Max the Employer Match**: First off, if your 401(k) has an employer match, throw in enough to snag that free cash. Itâ€™s basically a bonus, so donâ€™t leave that on the table. 
2. **Roth vs Traditional IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA options. If you can, go for a Roth IRA â€“ tax-free growth is like finding money in your couch cushions. However, if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket at retirement, a traditional IRA can have its perks too.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After that, fill up your taxable accounts. It might sound less sexy because of the taxes, but this is where you can get your hands on your money faster without those pesky early withdrawal penalties.

Basically, be smart, diversify your investments, and donâ€™t forget to occasionally chat with a financial guru to keep things spicy!
