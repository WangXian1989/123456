I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's very important that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They will be able to recommend specific treatments based on the type and severity of your liver condition. In general, treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek advice from a qualified medical provider for your health concerns.
