Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider when deciding how to allocate your funds:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Take advantage of the tax benefits; contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider using an IRA for additional retirement savings. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.
   - Depending on your income level, contributions to a Roth IRA may be limited, so assess which type works best for you.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to high capital gains taxes, or for shorter-term savings goals that you might want to access before retirement age.
   - Consider investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) and adjust as needed based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing from each account type. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be a tax-efficient strategy, as long as it aligns with your long-term investment goals.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement plans change.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor or tax professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
