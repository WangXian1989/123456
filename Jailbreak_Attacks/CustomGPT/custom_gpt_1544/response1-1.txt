To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, fund your IRA. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and manage high-interest debts before prioritizing investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility and can be beneficial for long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments like index funds in taxable accounts.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor for advice tailored to your situation.
