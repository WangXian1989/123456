To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for pre-tax growth, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Use for tax-deferred or tax-free growth, depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.
   - **Investment Types**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from taxes.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to an IRA if eligible; pay attention to income limits and contribution caps.
   - Invest excess funds in taxable accounts once max contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are achieved.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan tax-efficient withdrawal strategies for retirement, starting with taxable accounts and leaving tax-advantaged accounts until later.

By strategically allocating your resources, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
