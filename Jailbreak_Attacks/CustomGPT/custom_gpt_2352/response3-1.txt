The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but typically with lower contribution limits. There are Traditional and Roth IRAs, with different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can invest without tax advantages. Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider focusing on Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions) that allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you believe you will be in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) (pre-tax) could be beneficial.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute to both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. For example, max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in a taxable account.
   - A common strategy is to contribute to a 401(k) up to the match, then fund an IRA, and finally return to max out the 401(k) contributions.

5. **Re-evaluate Annually**: Review and adjust your allocation annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

6. **Consider Investment Types**: Certain investments are better suited for specific account types. For instance, hold investments that generate high dividends or short-term capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor who understands your personal financial situation can provide tailored advice.
