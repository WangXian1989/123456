(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax brackets, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After that, you can contribute to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Lastly, any remaining funds can be directed to a taxable account, which offers greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

First off, max out that 401(k) like itâ€™s your favorite snack â€“ especially if your employerâ€™s throwing in some matching funds; thatâ€™s like hitting the jackpot! Next up, look at your IRA options. The Roth IRA is awesome for tax-free withdrawals later, but if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might serve you better. Lastly, donâ€™t forget about your taxable accounts â€“ they're your wild card! You get the ultimate flexibility, but be ready to deal with the tax man when you cash out. Balance it out based on where you can get the most bang for your buck while considering your future plans and risk tolerance. Go get 'em!
