Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you want tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be the better option.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits (e.g., for 2023, it's $6,500 for those under 50, or $7,500 for those 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more accessible withdrawals without penalties, making them ideal for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Diversification**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to balance risk and returns.
- **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and life changes.

### Sample Allocation Approach:
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement savings, emphasizing growth-oriented funds.
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement savings, split between traditional and Roth based on tax outlook.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for short-term savings, with a focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

### Conclusion:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, including age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. This strategic distribution will help you maximize your savings while considering tax implications and accessibility.
