Distributing your money among different retirement and investment accounts—like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides a solid foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After getting the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Contributions to these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which can be beneficial over time.

3. **Balance between 401(k) and IRA:** If you still have money to invest after maxing out your IRAs, contribute more to your 401(k). Keep in mind that 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options but don't provide the same tax advantages.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Your investment strategy should also align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments (stocks), while those nearing retirement may focus on safer investments (bonds).

6. **Revisit Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with changing financial goals, market conditions, and your investment timeline.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
