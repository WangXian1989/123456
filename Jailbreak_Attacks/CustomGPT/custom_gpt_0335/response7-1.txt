Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute the Maximum**: If possible, aim to contribute the annual limit ($20,500 for under 50, $27,000 for 50 and older in 2023).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They offer more liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on long-term investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversify Contributions**: Balance your contributions based on projected tax implications at retirement and your time horizon.
- **Consider Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and bond investments in taxable accounts where they’re less tax-efficient.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Professional**
Finally, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
