To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k), especially if there's a match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred; taxes apply upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends may be taxed; consider holding long-term investments to reduce tax impact.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) to defer taxes.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider discussing with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

Following these steps can help optimize your investment and tax strategy while working toward your financial goals.
