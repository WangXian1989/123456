To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax deduction or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends for tax efficiency. 

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time frames can tolerate more risk (more stocks), while shorter durations may require safer investments (bonds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level.

By using these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing risk and tax implications.
