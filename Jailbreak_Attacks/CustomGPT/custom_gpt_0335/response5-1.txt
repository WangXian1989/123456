Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you qualify, consider maxing out traditional or Roth IRA contributions. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and investments. They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Taxation:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you expect to need access to funds sooner.

5. **Diversification:** Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance and goals. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocation periodically to adjust for market changes and to align with your investment strategy.
