Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations based on tax implications, investment goals, and your financial situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if your employer offers a good match and low fees. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction up front.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that might benefit from favorable capital gains rates. This is also useful for funds you may need access to before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep high-growth potential assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferrals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
