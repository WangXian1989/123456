Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions, depending on your tax situation.
   - If eligible, consider a Health Savings Account (HSA) as another tax-advantaged option.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that might generate significant capital gains. This could be a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, maintaining a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy to adapt to changes in tax laws, personal finances, and market conditions.

This strategy balances tax efficiency and growth potential, aligning with both short- and long-term financial goals.
