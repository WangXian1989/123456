Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older (including catch-up contributions).
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50) across all IRAs.
   - **Income Limits:** Be aware of income limits, especially for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer liquidity and no restrictions on withdrawals, making them ideal for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on realized gains and taxes on dividends and interest income.
   - **Investment Choices:** You can invest in a wider range of assets here without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k) to get the full match, as this provides an immediate return on your investment.
2. **Fund IRAs:** Next, aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth.
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is also a good place for assets with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

### **Other Considerations:**
- **Age and Time Horizon:** Younger investors may prefer growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may focus on more stable investments in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Implications:** Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts and ensure a balanced approach that mitigates tax burdens over time.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to spread risk.

### **Final Thoughts:**
A well-considered approach to asset allocation across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your portfolio's tax efficiency and growth potential. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
