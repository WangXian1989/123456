Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
- **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and tax is paid on withdrawals in retirement. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 per year ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider using them for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) contributions, then fund your IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts if you have additional funds.
- **Asset Allocation Consideration**: Implement a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### **Action Steps**
- **Assess Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
- **Review Tax Implications**: Monitor tax implications for withdrawals based on your current and expected future tax situations.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy allows you to leverage tax advantages, ensure liquidity, and work towards your financial goals effectively.
