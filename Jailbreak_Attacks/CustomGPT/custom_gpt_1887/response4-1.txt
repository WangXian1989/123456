The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If offered by your employer, especially if they provide a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if your financial situation allows.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Traditional IRAs can also be beneficial for tax deductions now, particularly if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term than retirement (e.g., buying a house, major purchases).
   - Make sure to consider tax implications on investments in these accounts, as they may be subject to capital gains tax upon selling.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Start with tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) up to any employer match, then consider maxing out one type of account before moving to the others.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Considerations**:
   - Evaluate your overall financial situation, including emergency savings, debt repayment, and financial goals.
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your tax efficiency while preparing for both short-term and long-term financial goals.
