To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. Consider whether your 401(k) offers a Roth option, which can provide tax-free growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After ensuring you max out your contributions to the above accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This could provide flexibility for short-term goals or liquidity as needed.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in these accounts, as they benefit from tax deferral. You can invest more aggressively here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to manage tax implications, as investment income can be taxed annually.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing market conditions and your financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of any fees associated with your 401(k) or IRA, as they can impact your returns over time.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement.

Always tailor these strategies to fit your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your needs.
