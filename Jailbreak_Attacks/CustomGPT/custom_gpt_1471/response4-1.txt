It's important to consider several factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, as each type of account has its own tax implications, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employeesâ€™ match, consider maxing out your IRA if you qualify for a deductible contribution. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**: If you've maximized your IRA contributions and still have funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties or age restrictions.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Allocate assets based on your current and expected future tax brackets. High-growth investments may be better suited in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can go into taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to stay within your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these guidelines to your specific situation to ensure the best outcome for your retirement savings.
