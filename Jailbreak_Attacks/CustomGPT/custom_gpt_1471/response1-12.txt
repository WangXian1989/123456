I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, reducing alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medical treatments can vary depending on the specific liver condition, so it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They might recommend medications or procedures if necessary. Always prioritize your health and seek professional guidance!
