I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might be helpful. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can help. Incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and help with weight management.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications might be prescribed. For instance, antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of liver cirrhosis.

3. **Avoidance of Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial, especially for conditions like alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help manage the condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people may consider milk thistle or other supplements, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
