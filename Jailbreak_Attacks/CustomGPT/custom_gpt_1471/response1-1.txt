When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here to enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you have a traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need in the short term since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider holding investments with higher growth potential, like stocks, that benefit from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Once in retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact, often favoring taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
