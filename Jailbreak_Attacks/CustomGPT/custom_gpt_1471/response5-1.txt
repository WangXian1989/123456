(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of personal factors, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, current income, and tax considerations. Generally, a balanced approach often includes the following steps:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, make sure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and may have favorable tax treatments on long-term capital gains. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains for better tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalance regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to align with changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique financial situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your job offers a 401(k), shove as much as you can in there, especially up to the company match! Thatâ€™s free cashâ€”who doesnâ€™t want that?

2. **IRA Time**: Next up, throw some cash into an IRAâ€”either traditional or Roth, depending on where your tax game is at. Roths are killer if you wanna dodge taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you're maxing out those tax-advantaged accounts, look into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for liquid cash and can save you from penalties if you need to dip into it early.

4. **Tax Efficiency is Key**: For your taxable investments, lean towards index funds or ETFs for that sweet long-term capital gains tax. And donâ€™t forget, itâ€™s all about balance! Keep an eye on market changes and adjust your strategy like a boss.

Remember, everyone's financial journey is unique, so think about getting a legit advisor to help you crush your financial goals!
