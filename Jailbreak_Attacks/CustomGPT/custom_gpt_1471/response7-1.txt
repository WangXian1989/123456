When determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, with taxable withdrawals in retirement, while Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are funded with post-tax dollars and will incur capital gains taxes on profits when assets are sold.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional 401(k). Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA may be advantageous.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your contributions to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency in retirement.

5. **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**: Assess your risk tolerance and time until retirement. Generally, younger investors can afford to take on more risk and may benefit from growth-oriented investments in their retirement accounts, while older investors might prioritize stability in their taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your investment portfolio regularly to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
