To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA first, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. This is particularly beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Take full advantage of employer match contributions first, as this is essentially "free" money. Note the annual contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Fund your IRA up to the limit (both traditional and Roth, if eligible), considering your tax situation to decide which type best aligns with your future plans.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral on potential higher earnings.
   - Consider placing more stable, income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize tax advantages available on municipal bonds or to allow for potential capital loss offsets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes, typically starting with taxable accounts before tapping into tax-deferred ones.
