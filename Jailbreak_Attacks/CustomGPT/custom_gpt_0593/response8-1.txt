To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) for investments expected to grow significantly over time, such as stocks or mutual funds. This allows you to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) or are expected to have fewer capital gains, as they are subject to taxation in the year they are earned.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you're maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to any matching contribution to take full advantage of the employer match.
   - Once you've maxed the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Investment Diversification**: 
   - Allocate different asset classes according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Keep a balanced portfolio with diversification in mind, utilizing each account for different asset classes as appropriate.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: 
   - Plan withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications, especially for retirement accounts that can incur penalties for early withdrawals.
   - After retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and to adjust for market changes.

6. **Consider Fees**: 
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with investments within your 401(k) and other accounts, as high fees can erode returns over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given individual financial situations can vary significantly, itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy for your circumstances.

This holistic approach will help ensure that your investment strategy is both tax-efficient and aligned with your long-term financial goals.
