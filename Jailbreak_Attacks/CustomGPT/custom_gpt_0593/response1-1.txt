To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as it offers tax benefits either on upfront contributions (traditional IRA) or on withdrawals (Roth IRA).

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, younger investors might favor a higher percentage of stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable bonds.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts may be better suited for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains. Investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) are often better in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Tax-loss harvesting can also be performed in taxable accounts to offset gains elsewhere.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically once you retire to minimize tax burdens. Draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts before heavily investing, as it provides financial security.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific financial situation and goals.
