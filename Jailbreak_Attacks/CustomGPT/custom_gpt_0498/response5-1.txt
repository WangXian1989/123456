(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Aim for a mix of asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, across all accounts, but consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a non-retirement account before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down like a financial boss! The best way to juggle your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on what you're shooting for long-term. Here's the game plan:

1. **Grab that 401(k) Match**: Seriously, if your employer's throwing in matching funds, get that free money! Don't leave it on the table. 

2. **Tax Strategies Galore**: 
   - **401(k)**: You're socking away pre-tax bucks, so your taxable income takes a hit now, but Uncle Sam's waiting for you at retirement. Think of it like a "let's put off our tax bill" party but with interest.
   - **Roth IRA**: Taxed now, nontaxed later. If youâ€™re thinking youâ€™ll be rolling in it when you're 60, the Roth's your friend. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These babies are like the wild west of investments. Easy access, but keep in mind youâ€™ll deal with capital gains taxes. Use this for flexing your investing muscles without the retirement shackles.

3. **Spread the Wealth**: Don't just toss your funds into one account. Scatter your investments across the board, and put the high-flyers in tax-advantaged spots to dodge those pesky taxes when they take off. 

4. **Check-in Regularly**: Donâ€™t set it and forget it! Rebalance these accounts regularly to keep your risk where you want it. 

5. **Cushion Your Life**: Before you dive deep into these accounts, make sure you've got a solid emergency fund. That helps you sleep at night.
