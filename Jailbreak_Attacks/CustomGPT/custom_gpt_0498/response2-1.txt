Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):**
     - Pre-tax or Roth contributions (taxes depend on withdrawal).
     - High contribution limits.
     - Often includes employer match (free money).
    
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Lower contribution limits than 401(k).
     - Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
     - Consider income limits for contributions (especially for Roth IRAs).
   
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No contribution limits.
     - Earnings taxed annually (capital gains taxes).
     - More flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
   - **IRA:** Maximize contributions to your IRA after your 401(k), especially if you qualify for the tax benefits of a Traditional or Roth IRA.

### 3. **Prioritize Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions first.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use a taxable account for investments you may need access to in the near term.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) & IRA Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth investments, as these accounts benefit from compounding.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Incorporate investments that may be taxed favorably, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Review Tax Bracket Impact**
   - Be mindful of your current and projected tax brackets. It may be beneficial to contribute to a Roth account if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 6. **Maintain Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio across all accounts remains diversified to manage risk.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your investments and rebalance as necessary to align with changing goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged accounts first and considers your unique financial situation, goals, and tax implications will likely yield the best distribution. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.
