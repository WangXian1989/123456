The best approach to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contributions to Roth IRA**:
   - If your income allows, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxable income.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it is advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to manage tax liabilities effectively.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk and enhance potential returns. Allocating assets differently based on tax treatment can help with this.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limit and IRA limit) to maximize tax-advantaged savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategic approach to distributing your money across these accounts. Would you like more information on any particular account type or strategy?
