To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions; often has higher contribution limits.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Individual retirement account with tax advantages, lower contribution limits than a 401(k) but broader investment choices (especially for Roth IRAs).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Non-retirement accounts with no contribution limits, but capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA):
  - **Maximize 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match to take advantage of free money.
  - Contribute to an **IRA** for additional tax benefits, especially if eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- Use **taxable accounts** for investments that are expected to generate taxed income, allowing them to grow tax-deferred in other accounts.

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match.
  - Next, max out your IRA contributions.
  - Finally, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
  - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments that can benefit most from tax deferral (stocks, mutual funds).
  - Allocate more conservative investments (bonds, fixed income) in taxable accounts, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly assess your investment distribution, considering age, risk tolerance, and changes in financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your investments among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation and retirement savings.
