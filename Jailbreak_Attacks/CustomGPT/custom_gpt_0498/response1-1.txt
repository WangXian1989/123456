Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured bullet-point analysis to guide your decision:

### 1. **Assess Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for long-term growth.
   - **Major Purchases**: Save in taxable accounts if you plan to make purchases within the next few years.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) Contributions**:
     - Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now.
     - Employer match maximizes your contributions with “free” money.
   - **IRA Types**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes owed on withdrawals during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions made with after-tax dollars; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.
     - Greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Annual limit (as of 2023) is $22,500; $30,000 if over age 50.
   - **IRA**: Annual limit is $6,500; $7,500 if over age 50.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but consider the tax efficiency of your investments.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - **Diversification**: Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust asset allocation based on performance and risk appetite.

### 5. **Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Utilize employer funds and low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that align with your long-term growth strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient stocks or funds; consider municipal bonds for tax-free interest.

### 6. **Regular Contributions and Reviews**
   - Automate contributions where possible to maintain consistency.
   - Regularly review allocations and performance at least once a year for necessary adjustments.

### Final Recommendations
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Focus on Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts.
- **Work with a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional guidance tailored to your unique situation.
