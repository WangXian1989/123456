Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, assess your contribution limit based on your financial situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars and can grow tax-free, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now but are taxed when you withdraw in retirement. Analyze which option aligns better with your current tax bracket and expected income in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, then look into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility without contribution limits, but be mindful of the tax implications on any capital gains and dividends.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers immediate tax implications and long-term growth potential is key. Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your specific goals is also recommended.
