I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options that may be discussed with a healthcare professional for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables can support liver health. Avoiding alcohol is crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
   - Antiviral drugs may be used for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare professional to monitor liver function.
   - Blood tests to track liver enzymes and functionality.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, ultimately, liver transplantation might be necessary.

It's important to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
