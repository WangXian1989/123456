Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Contributions Limits:**
   - Ensure you are aware of and are contributing within the limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs) since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding low-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes, and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses set aside in a liquid account before fully investing in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance. Adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Final Considerations:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
