Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. 
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, and you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes and may generate taxable income through dividends and interest.

### 3. **Factor in Investment Goals**
   - **401(k):** Generally for retirement, invest in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement age.
   - **IRA:** Similar to the 401(k), but offers more investment options. Consider your timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexibility for short-term goals, allowing for access without penalty before retirement age.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Debts**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. High-interest debts should be paid off before contributing significantly to investment accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full company match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After funding tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional funds here for flexibility.

### Regular Review
- Review and adjust your allocations annually or after significant life changes to ensure they still align with your financial goals.
