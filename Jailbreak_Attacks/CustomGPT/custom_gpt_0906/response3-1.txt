Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions often lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax-advantaged retirement account. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for any purpose, not tax-advantaged. Investment gains and dividends are taxable.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for tax deductions on a traditional IRA or want tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - If you plan to retire early or need access to funds before retirement, consider maintaining a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs for flexibility.
   - For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and those that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your investment allocations and performance.
   - Adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and contributions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seeking professional guidance can help tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances, ensuring an optimal approach to account distribution.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial objectives.
