Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and tax benefits. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit—it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions**: Depending on your financial situation, aim to contribute 10-15% of your salary.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribute**: Aim for the maximum contribution limit. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax Strategy**: Use Traditional IRAs for immediate tax deductions if you're in a higher tax bracket now, and Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals outside retirement (e.g., buying a home or funding education).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Balance Contributions**: Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then max out IRA contributions before allocating additional funds to a taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments**: Keep a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals. Rebalance your portfolio at least annually.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation and goals.
