Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (often considered "free money"). Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet the income limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions based on income and participation in an employer plan.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider holding assets that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Monitor Your Withdrawals**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage your tax bracket effectively, drawing first from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline and Withdrawals**
   - If you're far from retirement, focus more on growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If closer to retirement, ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Financial situations and tax laws change; review your allocations periodically, especially as retirement approaches or your income changes.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments across different account types for optimum growth and tax efficiency.
