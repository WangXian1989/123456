Î± Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a tailored approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, aim to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. For instance, hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains. In contrast, place higher-yield and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Assess your overall asset allocation across all accounts, ensuring diversification that aligns with your investment strategy. Adjust the allocation based on the specific characteristics and tax features of each account.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account any changes in contributions or market performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances and financial goals.
