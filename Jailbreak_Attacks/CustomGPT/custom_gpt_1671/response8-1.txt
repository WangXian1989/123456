When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind factors such as your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline that may help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next, especially if you are eligible for tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Fund the 401(k)**: After maximizing contributions to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This can help you benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use your taxable investment accounts for short-term goals or for money you may need access to before retirement. This can include investing in low-turnover funds to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place your most tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) and keep stocks in taxable accounts if you're planning to hold them long-term.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on your financial goals and market conditions. Adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of taxes and individual financial situations, consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.

Tailoring your distribution strategy will depend on your individual needs and goals, so itâ€™s important to consider these factors carefully.
