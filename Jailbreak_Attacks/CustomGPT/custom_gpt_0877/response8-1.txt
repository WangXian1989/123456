Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing this out if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions to an IRA for tax advantages. Choose a Roth IRA if you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher one later.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings.
   - Keep investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Balance Risk Across Accounts**:
   - Be mindful of asset allocation. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to limit short-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Take into Account Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the rules around withdrawals for each type of account, especially IRAs and 401(k)s, as early withdrawals can incur penalties.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - As your financial situation changes (job changes, market conditions, etc.), review and adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy that works best for your circumstances.
