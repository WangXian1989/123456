Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs give tax deductions now; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested funds are subject to capital gains tax on profits. They offer flexibility since there are no withdrawal penalties or contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least to the level of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out an IRA if you have the option, especially if you can utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve maximized retirement accounts. They are useful for short-term goals or if you’ve hit contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Focus on tax efficiency. Place higher-tax investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and lower-tax investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize annual tax liabilities.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Timeline**
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Long-term investments typically go into retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
  
### 5. **Regular Adjustments**
   - Revisit your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your current financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds for other investments or short-term goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts can enhance your savings potential while managing tax implications effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
