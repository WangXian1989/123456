Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money!
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect higher taxes in retirement, a Roth IRA might be better. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility compared to retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of tax implications on investments. Consider tax-efficient strategies, like investing in index funds or ETFs.

### Strategy Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the match, then max out your IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Balance Risk**: Diversify investments across all accounts, adjusting your risk tolerance based on the account type.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations yearly, adjusting based on performance, life changes, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
