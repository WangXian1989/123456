Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: This is tax-deferred, which helps reduce your taxable income now. Prioritize contributions here to lower your current tax bill.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deferral, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or ETFs that pay qualified dividends.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Regular Re-evaluation**: Periodically review allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Always consider your risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and financial goals when deciding how to allocate your investments.
