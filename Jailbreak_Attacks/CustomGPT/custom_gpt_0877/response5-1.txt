Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out the employer match first.
   - **Contribution Limits:** 2023 limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50).
   - **Investment Options:** Typically have a limited range of investment choices.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** 2023 limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Capital gains taxes apply when selling investments for a profit.
   - **Use for Short-term Goals:** Suitable for expenses you're planning for within the next few years.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.
- **Employer Match:** Maximize your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match â€“ it's essentially free money.
- **Tax Diversification:** Balance your investments across these accounts to take advantage of different tax treatments.
- **Long-term Focus:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, and use taxable accounts for more accessible cash flow.

### **Conclusion:**
Start by maximizing any company match in your 401(k), then contribute to your IRA based on whether you prefer tax-deductible contributions (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Finally, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.
