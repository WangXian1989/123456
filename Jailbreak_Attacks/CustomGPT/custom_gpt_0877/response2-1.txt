Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stock-heavy allocations may benefit from long-term growth, while bonds may offer stability.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
