(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are a few guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this before moving to other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if you're in a lower tax bracket now, as the contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Consider whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax) aligns better with your current and expected future tax situation.
   - If you qualify, aim to max out your IRA contributions as they provide tax advantages and investment growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these accounts for more flexible investments. They can be helpful for short to medium-term goals, as you can easily access funds.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, like the 401(k) up to the employer match, then move on to the IRA, and lastly allocate funds to taxable accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like playing a game of financial Tetris, where you want to fit the pieces together for maximum advantage. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Hit that 401(k) Sweet Spot**: If your employerâ€™s throwing down a match, snag that free cash first! Donâ€™t leave that on the table; itâ€™s like passing up a free drink at a party. Contribute enough to max that match, then think about going to other accounts if you can.

2. **IRA Time to Shine**: Next, roll over to an IRA. Youâ€™ve got two flavors â€“ Traditional and Roth. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, go Roth. If youâ€™re thinking youâ€™ll be earning less in the future, then Traditional is your jam. Aim to hit those max contribution limits to turbocharge your tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, dive into your taxable accounts. Here, you get to be a bit more strategic. Buy low, sell high, but also keep that tax efficiency in mind. Try index funds or ETFs for less tax drama later on. Plus, these accounts give you liquidity, so when you wanna splurge on that vacation, you can do it without messing with your retirement stash.

Basically, funnel your funds into the 401(k) first, then tackle the IRA, and round it out with taxable accounts. Happy investing! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
