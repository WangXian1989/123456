Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a critical decision for optimizing your investment strategy and achieving your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to consider:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type

- **401(k):**
  - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
  - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of it.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
  - **Types:** Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid on withdrawal) vs. Roth IRA (after-tax contributions; tax-free withdrawals).
  - **Contribution Limits:** Generally lower than those for a 401(k).

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - **Flexibility and Accessibility:** Investments can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, though capital gains taxes may apply.
  - **Investment Choices:** Typically broader than retirement accounts.

### 2. Determine Your Priorities and Goals

- **Short-term Needs:** If you need access to your funds within a few years, prioritize your taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Growth:** For retirement, maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can compound growth over time.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy

- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
  
- **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if a Roth IRA fits your tax situation.

- **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).

- **Plan for Taxable Accounts:** Use any leftover savings for taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable capital gains treatment.

|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)               | 1st to get employer match     | Contribute enough to get the full match            |
| IRA                  | 2nd to max out contributions  | Consider fund types and tax implications            |
| Taxable Accounts      | 3rd for liquidation flexibility| Invest in tax-efficient funds                        |

### Conclusion

Balancing your investments across these accounts allows you to leverage their unique benefits. Regularly reevaluate your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
