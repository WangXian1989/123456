1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** A balanced diet low in saturated fats, processed foods, and sugars can help improve liver health. Consider incorporating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular Check-Ups:** Regular visits to a healthcare provider for monitoring liver function tests can help catch any issues early.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol and Drugs:** Limiting or avoiding alcohol and certain medications can prevent further liver damage.
