It's great that you're considering how to effectively distribute your money across different investment accounts! Here's a brief overview of how to approach this:

### Factors to Consider

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). You can also consider a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made after-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on any gains and dividends each year, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - For short-term goals, a taxable account may be more appropriate due to its liquidity.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits for each type of account (401(k), IRA, etc.) and aim to maximize those first.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

- **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—this is essentially free money.
  
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
  - Contribute to your 401(k) to the max allowed (if you can).
  - If you have the option, contribute to a Roth IRA after maxing out or meeting contributions for your 401(k).
  
- **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**:
  - Any savings beyond retirement accounts can go into a taxable account.
  - Use this account for more accessible growth investments that you might need in the near term.

### Example Distribution

- **401(k)**: 50% of total investment dollars until you hit the contribution limit or employer match.
- **IRA**: 20% of total investment dollars (selecting Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Account**: 30% of total investment dollars (for flexibility and post-retirement access).

### Review and Adjust

Regularly review your investment strategy to accommodate changes in financial goals, life circumstances, and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio to stay in line with your investment strategies.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for a more personalized allocation based on your specific situation and risk tolerance!
