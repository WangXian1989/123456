Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential matching contributions. It's tax-advantaged for retirement savings.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax benefits for retirement; can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside retirement accounts, where capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available).
   - This is essentially "free money" and a great first step.

2. **IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA.
   - If eligible, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, look to fill a taxable account.
   - This is good for flexibility and potential short-term goals.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income in the current year.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits from investments when they're sold.

### 4. Assess Your Time Horizon
- **Short-term Goals (0-5 years)**: Consider more liquid options like a taxable account or cash savings.
- **Medium to Long-term Goals (5+ years)**: 401(k) and IRA should be your primary focus due to their tax advantages.

### 5. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift. Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your distributions accordingly.
- **MonitorChange in Finances**: If your income, expenses, or financial goals change, adjust your contribution levels to each account as necessary.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary to reach the employer match.
- **IRA**: Up to the maximum contribution limit after the 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings can go here for flexibility.

### Conclusion
This approach can help you make informed decisions about distributing your money across your accounts. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your specific situation and needs.
