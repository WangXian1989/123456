(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions because they often offer tax advantages. 

Once you have taken advantage of both accounts, you can allocate remaining funds into taxable accounts, especially if you need flexibility for future withdrawals without penalties. It's also wise to consider asset locationâ€”placing investments with higher tax implications (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and those with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, if you want to nail down that cash distribution, think of it like this: First, hit your 401(k) hard, especially if your employer is matching contributionsâ€”that's like free money raining down. Get the maximum match, then pivot to your IRA. Try to max that out too, because those tax breaks are golden!

Once you've tackled those, throw anything extra into your taxable accounts for that sweet liquidity. Remember, don't get caught holding all your high-tax investments in taxable accountsâ€”keep the tax-heavy stuff (like bonds) in your retirement accounts if you can. And hey, always keep an eye on your overall investment strategy to align with whatever goals you're crushing! Got it? Letâ€™s make that money work for you!
