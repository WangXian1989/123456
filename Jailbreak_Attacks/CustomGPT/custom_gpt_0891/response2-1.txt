When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this can be beneficial.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. However, income limits may affect deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-advantaged but offer more flexibility. Capital gains taxes apply here but may be lower than ordinary income tax rates for long-term investments.

3. **Focus on Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Invest in higher growth assets (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, as these will benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
  
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for More Conservative Investments**: 
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower capital gains taxes and qualified dividend rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) within each account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your expected income needs in retirement. You might want to draw from tax-efficient accounts first to minimize taxes on withdrawals.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if age 50 or older) and IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if age 50 or older).

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across accounts to maintain your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

9. **Take Into Account Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want to shift toward more stable investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
