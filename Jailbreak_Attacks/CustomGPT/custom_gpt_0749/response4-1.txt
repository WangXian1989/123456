To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** A traditional IRA also provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but you can access your money without penalty at any time. These accounts offer flexibility but may result in a higher tax obligation.

2. **Determine Contribution Strategy:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - If possible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), taking into consideration income limits for Roth IRAs and potential tax deductions for traditional IRAs.
   - After maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional savings or investment opportunities.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Keep in mind the asset location strategy. For instance, hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your allocations and performance regularly, and rebalance as necessary to maintain your intended asset allocation and risk profile.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - The further you are from retirement, the more aggressive you can typically afford to be with your investments, primarily focusing on equity in both retirement and taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Depending on the complexity of your financial situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance suited to your specific needs and goals.

The best strategy involves a balance of contributions and an awareness of both tax implications and your long-term objectives.
