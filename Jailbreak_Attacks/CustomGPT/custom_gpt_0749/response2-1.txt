When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. For 2023, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 for those over 50) for 401(k) and $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50) for IRAs. 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider placing higher-growth assets, such as stocks or equity funds, in your 401(k) because the growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), it's often wise to hold growth-oriented investments here as well. If you have a Roth IRA, consider placing assets that are expected to grow significantly since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that generate income or are likely to see maximum short-term gains (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - Diversify across tax brackets. Having investments in accounts with different tax treatments can provide flexibility in retirement to withdraw funds strategically.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you wonâ€™t need the money for many years, you can afford to be more aggressive (more stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. If you're approaching your retirement target, consider reallocating funds to more conservative investments (like bonds) to preserve capital.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts that covers 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions as your financial goals and market conditions change.

The best approach can vary based on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines, so it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
