To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Target 15-20% of your salary if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize stocks or equity funds in your 401(k) and IRAs where tax deferral can enhance growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets or bonds in taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio by diversifying your investments across all accounts, accounting for taxes and withdrawal rules efficiently. 

Adopting this strategic approach will help you optimize your investments while minimizing taxes over time.
