Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for achieving your financial goals. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment options offered in your 401(k). They may have higher fees compared to IRAs.
   - **Pre-Tax Advantages:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short-term savings or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading in taxable accounts. Long-term investments (held for over a year) often result in lower tax rates compared to short-term gains.

### **General Strategies:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Prioritize building an emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.
- **Consider Time Horizon:** Balance your risk tolerance and investment strategy with your time horizon for needing the money.

### **Sample Distribution:**
- **25% to 401(k)** (take full advantage of any employer match)
- **25% to IRA** (consider a Roth IRA for future tax benefits)
- **50% to Taxable Accounts** (for flexibility and short-term investments)

### **Final Consideration:**
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your personal financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.
