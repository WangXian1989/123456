The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contribution, as contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you are eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRAs reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as income. Conversely, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Needs**:
   - Keep sufficient funds in a taxable account or cash for short-term needs and emergencies, since withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

6. **Long-term Strategy**:
   - Consider your time horizon. Funds in retirement accounts are generally intended for the long haul, so you may want to take more aggressive positions in those accounts compared to taxable accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals.

Balancing contributions to each account type while taking tax efficiency and investment growth into account can lead to better long-term financial outcomes.
