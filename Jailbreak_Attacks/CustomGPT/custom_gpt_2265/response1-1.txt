Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher immediate tax advantages.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional offers tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed at capital gains rates, making them suitable for short-term goals or if you want to access funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or if you need funds before retirement age.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to your IRA (up to the annual limit).
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional saving or investing.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a strategy for which accounts to withdraw from in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize cash flow.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
