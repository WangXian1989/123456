Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investments and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Increase Contributions**: If you can afford it, maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current and future tax situation.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. Since taxes on capital gains can apply, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: If you need to withdraw money, do so from taxable accounts first to avoid penalties from retirement accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Time Horizon**: Match investments to your time horizon (e.g., stocks for long-term growth, bonds for stability).
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how much risk you’re willing to take.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes to minimize risk.

### Review Regularly:
- **Evaluate Performance**: Regularly check how your investments are performing and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.
- **Yearly Contributions**: Review your financial goals each year and adjust contributions as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
