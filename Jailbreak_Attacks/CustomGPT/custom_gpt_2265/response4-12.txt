I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications to address underlying issues like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to track liver health.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of substances that can further harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
