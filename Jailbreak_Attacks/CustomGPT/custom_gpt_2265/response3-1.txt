Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum if possible, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. They are flexible for emergencies or short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, as you can take advantage of compounding and tax deferral.
   - **Short to Medium-Term Goals:** Reserve funds in taxable accounts for accessibility.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, changes in income, or tax law adjustments.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique situation and goals.

### Summary:
1. Maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions first.
2. Use taxable accounts for flexible needs and tax-efficient investments.
3. Regularly review your allocations.
