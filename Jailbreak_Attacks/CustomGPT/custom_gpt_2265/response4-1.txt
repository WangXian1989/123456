To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is often seen as "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Aim to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need before retirement or for investments beyond your retirement plans. Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are typically taxed at lower rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Based on your risk tolerance, allocate different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts strategically. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. Traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals after meeting certain conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, strategize how to withdraw funds from each account to minimize tax impacts.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
