To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Since contributions are tax-deferred, prioritize this account for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current versus expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Choices**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in choices; stick to low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Usually offers a wider range; consider diversifying across assets.
   - **Taxable**: Use for tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, municipal bonds).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account before heavy investing.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation. 

This balanced approach can optimize your growth while managing tax implications effectively.
