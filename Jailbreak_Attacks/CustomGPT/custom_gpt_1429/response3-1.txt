Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k):**
   - Once you've funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. For example, consider index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. If you’re likely to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investment mix across all accounts is diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexity of tax implications, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This strategy helps optimize your contributions while considering both immediate and long-term financial goals.
