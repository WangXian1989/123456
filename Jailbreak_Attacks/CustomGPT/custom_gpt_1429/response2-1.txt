Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you allocate funds effectively:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year if you can afford it.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for short- to mid-term goals or when you need liquidity. This can include savings for a home, travel, or other significant expenses.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Put bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts, where capital gains rates may be more favorable.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to align with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (to max out if possible)
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed after your 401(k) match
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings or for short-term goals

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances can significantly influence the best strategy, so consider professional advice for tailored planning.

By carefully considering these factors and gradually increasing your contributions, you can create a well-rounded and effective investment strategy.
