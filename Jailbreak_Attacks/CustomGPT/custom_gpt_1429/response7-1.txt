Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to maximize any employer match and consider increasing your contributions as you can, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility but don’t offer the same tax advantages.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Annually review and rebalance your portfolio to align it with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

This strategy can help optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax efficiency.
