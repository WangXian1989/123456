Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize contributions here if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you think your tax rate will rise, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Check annual limits and aim to maximize contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds since they offer more liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains rather than interest income, as capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes to minimize risk.
- **Reassess**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your goals or market conditions change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your individual circumstances can provide clarity and direction.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize for taxes, growth, and accessibility—all while working towards your financial goals!
