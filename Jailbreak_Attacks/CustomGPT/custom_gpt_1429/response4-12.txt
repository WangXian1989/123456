I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and engaging in regular exercise can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Management of Complications**: Treatments for complications like ascites may include diuretics, while others may require more invasive procedures.

5. **Transplantation**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be considered.

Itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
