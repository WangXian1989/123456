I'm not a doctor, but treatment for liver issues varies based on the specific problemâ€”like fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet, exercise, and weight management can be crucial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might reduce inflammation or treat infections.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up tests to assess liver function.
4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Essential for many liver conditions.
5. **Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
