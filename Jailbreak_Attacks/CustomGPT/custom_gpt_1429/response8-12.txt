I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options depend on the specific liver condition, but they may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and weight loss can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Various medications can treat specific liver diseases, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function and make necessary adjustments in treatment.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like biliary drainage or liver transplantation may be considered.

Again, please consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation.
