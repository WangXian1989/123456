(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, for tax-free growth. If youâ€™re eligible for a traditional IRA and want to reduce your taxable income, consider that as well.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! You want to get the most bang for your buck, right? Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: Go max out that employer match! Free money, baby! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions.
2. **Roth IRA Love**: If you're eligible, throw some cash into a Roth IRA. That tax-free growth is like having your cake and eating it too, plus it wonâ€™t hit you with taxes in retirement!
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve milked the tax-advantaged accounts dry, move to taxable accounts. Just keep it efficientâ€”index funds over actively managed, unless you love throwing money away on fees.

And remember, your strategy should flex with your goals and how much you wanna keep Uncle Sam out of your pocket. A financial advisor can help you navigate this without losing your mind!
