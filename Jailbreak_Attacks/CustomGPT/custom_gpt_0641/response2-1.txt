When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and rules. Can be a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax advantages. Taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify and want tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments that you expect to hold long-term to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts, as they generate regular taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Don't over-concentrate in a single investment or asset class.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline should dictate asset allocation. Younger investors may opt for more equities, while those nearing retirement might favor bonds and lower volatility investments.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Annually review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in financial goals, or life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

By balancing contributions and investment strategies across these accounts, you can create a robust plan for retirement savings.
