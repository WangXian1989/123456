(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as 401(k)s offer tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

Diversifying your investments within these accounts is also essential. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! The “best” way to distribute your cash really depends on what your financial game plan looks like. 

First off, smash your 401(k) contributions—especially get that employer match because, like, who doesn’t want free money?! Toss in as much as you can after that. Then swing over to your IRA. If you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement and you’re not planning on being a millionaire, the Roth IRA could be your best buddy. 

Once you hit the ceilings of those tax-advantaged accounts, it’s time for your taxable accounts. Think of them as your “here and now” fund; good for your next vacation or fresh kicks. 

But keep your investments spread out and diversified like a great playlist—variety is key. And hey, if you’re still scratching your head on this, a financial advisor can help turn that confused frown upside down!
