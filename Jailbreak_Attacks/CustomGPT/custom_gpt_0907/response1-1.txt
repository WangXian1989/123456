Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you qualify, consider maxing out your Roth IRA next. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your Roth IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions, especially if you can benefit from additional tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Account Contributions:** Use taxable accounts for funds beyond retirement accounts or for investments that you may need to access before retirement age. Keep in mind the tax implications on investment gains here.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Consider the types of assets you hold in each account. High-growth stocks might be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while low-yield bonds might be fine in taxable accounts due to lower tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure you're aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your investments and tax strategy.

Adjust the percentages based on your personal goals and risk tolerance.
