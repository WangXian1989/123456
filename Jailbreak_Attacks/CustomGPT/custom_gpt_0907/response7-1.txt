Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If offered through your employer, consider contributing enough to get any matching contributions (this is essentially free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as these accounts grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you want tax deductions now, consider a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexible withdrawal options but come with capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance and Timeline**
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can be more aggressive since you wonâ€™t need the funds for several years. In contrast, taxable accounts should house investments that you may access sooner.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you have a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your investment goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions based on your eligibility (Roth or traditional).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on a mix of growth and income-generating assets.

### Additional Considerations:
- Evaluate your tax bracket to make the best decisions about which accounts to prioritize.
- Keep an eye on contribution limits and changing rules for retirement accounts.
