Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,500 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). The limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Consider your current and future tax situations. A Roth IRA might be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **After-Tax Savings:** Use these for additional investments once you're maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more access to your funds without penalty, making them useful for medium-term goals.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to match, then fund your IRA. After maxing out these accounts, use any additional savings for your taxable account.
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your asset allocation across these accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
