Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which means you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. 
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). Traditional IRAs have tax advantages now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside of retirement accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - Contribute to your IRA if you are eligible, as this can provide additional tax advantages.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Deferral**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income or for short-term saving goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help balance risk and return based on your investment strategy.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Ongoing Assessment**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if thereâ€™s an employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit, using a Roth IRA if you meet income requirements.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use this for additional savings and investments, particularly for goals beyond retirement.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals.
