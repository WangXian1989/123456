Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as tax implications, your retirement goals, and your current financial situation. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling, but they offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. If your income allows, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Balancing between pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in retirement.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access within 5-10 years.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts, allowing them to grow without immediate tax consequences.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Younger Investors**: Consider aggressive investments in taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - **Annual Review**: Evaluate your allocations yearly to reflect changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### **Example Allocation (Hypothetical) Based on Age:**
- **Under 40**: 
  - 401(k): 20% 
  - IRA: 20% 
  - Taxable: 10%
- **40-60**: 
  - 401(k): 25% 
  - IRA: 25% 
  - Taxable: 10%
- **60+**: 
  - 401(k): 20% 
  - IRA: 20% 
  - Taxable: 20%

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances. Diversifying your investments can help mitigate risk and maximize returns over time.
