Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your financial situation. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Income from investments in these accounts can be taxed each year, so consider this when deciding where to place investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Your risk tolerance should guide how you allocate your investments. Stocks can offer higher returns (and risk) compared to bonds.
   - **Investment Horizon:** Longer time horizons can allow for more aggressive investments, while shorter ones may necessitate a more conservative approach.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify within each account to mitigate risk. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments across your accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Considerations:
- **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing contributions.
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses) before investing excess cash.
