To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which is more beneficial based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They provide flexibility, but also incur tax liabilities.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10+ years) goals. Allocate money accordingly:
     - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts with lower volatility.
     - Long-term goals can benefit from aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Location**:
   - Hold higher-growth and higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts, as they may generate taxable income.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. Max out employer matches in your 401(k) and consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on eligibility.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts to manage risk. Ensure each account aligns with your overall asset allocation strategy.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This approach ensures you maximize tax benefits while strategically growing your investments.
