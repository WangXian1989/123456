I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, avoid alcohol, and maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome for your health.
