Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual maximum limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings, particularly if you want more flexibility or if you're planning for short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so it’s beneficial to seek tailored advice.

This approach balances tax advantages while allowing for growth and flexibility.
