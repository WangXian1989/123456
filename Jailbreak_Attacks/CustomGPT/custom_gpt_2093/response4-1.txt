When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more effectively.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50+) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50+).

3. **Consider Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before diverting funds to other accounts.

4. **Analyze Investment Options**: Look at the investment options available in each account. Your 401(k) may have limited choices, while an IRA can offer a broader selection. 

5. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, earnings in a taxable account are subject to capital gains tax, so consider your current and anticipated tax bracket when investing.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Prioritize leaving funds in your taxable account if you may need to access them before retirement, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can incur penalties if taken before age 59Â½.

7. **Long-Term Investment Horizon**: The longer you can keep money invested, the more beneficial tax-advantaged accounts can be. If retirement is far away, maximize these accounts.

8. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your investment distributions regularly to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
