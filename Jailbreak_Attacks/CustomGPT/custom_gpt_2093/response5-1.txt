(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. A common approach is:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This can provide immediate returns on your investment.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments or if youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.

It's advisable to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! When it comes to distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all, but hereâ€™s a solid strategy:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer matches contributions, max that out! Itâ€™s free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table. Contribute as much as you can without wrecking your budget.

2. **IRA**: Next, hit up that IRA! A Roth IRA is killer if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later on. If you want the tax break now, go for a Traditional IRA. Just know the rules!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these bad boys for flexibility. Once you cap out on your tax-advantaged accounts, toss your extra money here. Look for stuff that wonâ€™t get you slammed with taxesâ€”index funds, anyone?

And hey, don't forget to tweak your allocations every so often based on how your goals and the market are looking. You got this! ðŸ’¸
