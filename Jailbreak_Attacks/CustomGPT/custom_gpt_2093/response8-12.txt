2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.

5. **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B may be advised if you're at risk.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle or turmeric, but always consult a doctor before starting them.
