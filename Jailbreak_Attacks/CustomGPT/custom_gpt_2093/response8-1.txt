Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you may have tax advantages on contributions or withdrawals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can grow, but you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on stocks or other growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals and consider more liquid, taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
