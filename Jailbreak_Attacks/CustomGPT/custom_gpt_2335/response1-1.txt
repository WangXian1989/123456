When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of mutual funds or ETFs based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribute**: Maximize contributions to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep funds for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Asset Allocation Strategy:
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term needs and to hold more tax-efficient investments.
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Hold assets that you expect to grow significantly and may incur ordinary income upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Use for long-term investments that can grow tax-free.

**Consulting a financial advisor** can help tailor a plan based on your goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
