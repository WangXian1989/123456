The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, max out contributions to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as you pay taxes now at a potentially lower rate.
   - A Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be preferable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.

### 3. **Diversify Across Account Types**
   - Balance your investments by keeping some in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity, especially for short-term goals.
   - Taxable accounts can also hold investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Review Investment Choices**
   - Choose investments for tax-advantaged accounts that may generate higher taxes, like bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account distribution based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach helps optimize your tax situation while preparing for retirement.
