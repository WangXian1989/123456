Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Strategy**: 
  - A **Traditional IRA** offers tax deductions now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  - A **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you anticipate higher future taxes.
- **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual contribution limits and consider maximizing your IRA once you've optimized your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more access and flexibility without penalties, which is great for short-term goals or emergency funds.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Final Thoughts
- Tailor your strategy based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice to suit your specific situation.
