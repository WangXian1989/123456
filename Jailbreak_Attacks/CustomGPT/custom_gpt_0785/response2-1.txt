To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a few key factors. Here’s a general guideline to help you think through your options:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can reduce your taxable income, and withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on any capital gains when sold, and dividends are taxed as income. These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you are aiming for long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA for your higher-risk investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those you might want to access before retirement.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. Max out your employer’s 401(k) match, then consider contributing to an IRA, and finally, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - If you have short-term goals (like purchasing a home), you might lean towards taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio. This can minimize risk and optimize returns.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, establish an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

A typical strategy might look like this:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA** (up to the contribution limit).
- **Invest in a taxable account** with any remaining funds.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals. What are your specific goals and circumstances? This could help refine the advice further!
