Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: Often have employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and high contribution limits.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize employer contributions first. If you can, contribute enough to get the full match, then focus on other accounts.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Types**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and can be used for short-term goals. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Strategy**: Use this for investments that might generate lower capital gains tax when sold or for savings goals that are shorter-term than retirement.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Start with 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Max Out IRA**: If you're eligible, target maxing out your IRA contribution next.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Fund these last, especially if you’re focusing on long-term tax-advantaged growth.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might focus on aggressive growth strategies, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative investments.
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk.

It's ideal to review your specific financial situation or consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice. What are your main goals for these accounts?
