Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guide to help you think through your options:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional 401(k)s lower your taxable income today, while Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Typically limited to a selection of funds provided by the employer.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits for contributions (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50, with higher limits for those 50 and over).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs generally provide more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Funds in taxable accounts are accessible without penalties, making them useful for shorter-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on gains when selling investments; long-term capital gains rates are generally lower.
   - **Flexibility**: You can invest in a wide range of assets without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate funds to a taxable account.
- **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Consider your current and future tax situations. Tax diversification can help manage tax liabilities in retirement.
- **Adjust for Risk Tolerance**: Depending on how comfortable you are with risk, you might allocate more to stocks in taxable accounts (for long-term benefits) and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (to minimize taxes on interest).

### Things to Consider
- **Retirement Age**: The younger you are, generally more aggressive you can afford to be.
- **Withdrawals**: Think about when you’ll need access to the funds—this will influence where you allocate money.
- **Financial Goals**: Define your short-term versus long-term goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your unique situation. What are your financial goals?
