Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match to maximize your benefits.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), influencing your taxable income today and in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the funds available, cost ratios, and performance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits and deadlines.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for funds you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on investments that have favorable tax treatments, such as long-term capital gains.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing aggressively.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.
3. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across all account types to balance risk and return.
4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total income, focusing on the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible, utilizing either traditional or Roth IRA based on your situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds can be invested here, especially for short-term needs.

### Personal Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Horizon**: Younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement should prioritize stability.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess how much risk you’re willing to take on based on your investment goals.

It might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances and goals.
