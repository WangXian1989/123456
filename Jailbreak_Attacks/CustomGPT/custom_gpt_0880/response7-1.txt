Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to capture the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if financially feasible.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - Aim for the maximum contribution limit to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**:
   - After funding your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (bonds, REITs) and keep stocks in taxable accounts where long-term capital gains may apply.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy to align with your changing goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

By considering your individual circumstances, you can create an effective distribution strategy that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liabilities.
