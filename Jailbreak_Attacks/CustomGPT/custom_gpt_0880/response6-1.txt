To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching to maximize free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employer match, focus on maxing out the IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits (traditional vs. Roth).

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shelter them from taxes.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Keep less tax-efficient assets (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower capital gains tax.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Minimize Taxes**: In retirement, prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: Consider your tax bracket when withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance your accounts periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - **Stay Informed**: Adapt to changes in tax laws or personal circumstances that could affect your strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
