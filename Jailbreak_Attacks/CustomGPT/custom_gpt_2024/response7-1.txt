To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications:
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they're earned. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate if assets are held over a year.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Max contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for the tax-free growth.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **Growth Investments**: Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
- **Bonds and income-generating assets**: These may be better placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. Consider Your Time Horizon:
- If you're close to retirement, a more conservative approach may be prudent.
- For younger investors, a growth-oriented approach can help accumulate wealth over time.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly:
- Review and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation in each account.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor:
- A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By conducting a strategic review of taxes, employer contributions, asset allocation, and regular rebalancing, you can optimize your investments across your accounts for long-term growth.
