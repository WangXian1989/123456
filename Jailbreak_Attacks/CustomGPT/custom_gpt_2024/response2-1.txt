Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Good for long-term growth.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short- to medium-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions by Tax Efficiency**
   - **First**: Max out the 401(k) up to the match.
   - **Second**: Fund a Roth or Traditional IRA (depending on your situation).
   - **Third**: Return to 401(k) to max out contributions ($22,500 for 2024).
   - **Fourth**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts but consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and safer ones (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations and contributions annually or when your financial situation changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Start with the employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to IRAs based on tax efficiency, followed by maximizing your 401(k) contributions and taxable investments as needed. Regularly review your investments and consult professionals when necessary.
