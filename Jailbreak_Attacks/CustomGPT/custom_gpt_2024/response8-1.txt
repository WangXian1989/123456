Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide access to your money without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Creation of a Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Generally, itâ€™s best to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
- **Investment Choices**: Place higher-growth (riskier) assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth. Keep more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.
- **Review Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
A tailored approach based on your specific financial situation is advisable, especially for tax implications and long-term planning.
