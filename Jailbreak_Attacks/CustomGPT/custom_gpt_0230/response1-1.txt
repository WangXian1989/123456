Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match if available.
   - Use for tax-deferred growth; contributions reduce taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if eligible).
   - Traditional IRA provides potential tax deductions; good for higher-income years.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends; tax rates may be lower than ordinary income.
   - Good for liquidity and flexibility.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Emergency Savings**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash.
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Aim for the employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRAs**: Use traditional or Roth depending on tax situation.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: For additional savings while maximizing tax efficiency.

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Review asset allocation regularly.
- Make adjustments based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
