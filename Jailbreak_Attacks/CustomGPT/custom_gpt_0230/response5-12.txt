I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treats underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Stay away from substances that can harm the liver, such as certain medications and chemicals.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
