Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: At least contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Types**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and phase-out ranges based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, offering liquidity for shorter-term goals.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider using this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in a savings account.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts and high-turnover or income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - **Annual Check-Up**: Review your allocations regularly and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions to each account type while considering your overall financial plan is key. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
