To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax benefits similar to 401(k)s. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to reduce risk.

A balanced approach typically prioritizes maxing out accounts with tax benefits first, then investing in taxable accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.
