When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your tax situation, investment goals, retirement timeline, and overall financial strategy. Here’s a general framework to help you make the decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify for an IRA, consider contributing to it after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, and Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (subject to conditions). Choose between them based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Supplement with 401(k) Contributions:** If you can still afford to invest more after maximizing contributions to your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access your funds without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Think about your current and projected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket, consider Roth options.

6. **Maintain Diversification:** Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

7. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it’s vital to review your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions as necessary.

Before making any significant decisions, it may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
