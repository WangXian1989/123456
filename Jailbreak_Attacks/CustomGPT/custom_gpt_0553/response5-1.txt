(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money. Max out contributions if you can afford to, considering the limit for 2024 is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to both traditional and Roth IRAs if you're eligible. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA might give you immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility. Remember that investments in this account are subject to capital gains taxes, so it may be beneficial to hold investments for the long term to minimize taxes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that fits your personal financial situation.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employerâ€™s throwing in a match, you better jump on that train! It's like finding cash under your couch cushions. Aim to max it out if you can swing itâ€”up to $23,000 a year. Save that cash pre-tax and let it grow like a weed. 

2. **IRA**: Next, think about rolling some of that cash into an IRA. Not only does a traditional IRA give you sweet tax deductions now, but if youâ€™re opting for a Roth, your future self will thank you. Tax-free withdrawals, baby! Just remember the income limits and whether youâ€™re eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Last stop: taxable accounts. Use these as your flex fund, but watch those capital gains like a hawk. Itâ€™s all about tax strategyâ€”hold onto stuff for a year to dodge that short-term capital gains tax and keep things growing. Mix it up, throw a little cash here and there, and keep it interesting!

So, bust out the balance and spread it wisely! And hey, consider a financial wizard (a.k.a. advisor) to craft that perfect potion for your wealth.
