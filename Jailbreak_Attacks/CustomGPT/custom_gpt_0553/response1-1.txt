Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best strategy:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment choices available in your 401(k) and their fees.

2. **IRAs (Roth or Traditional):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Consider the tax implications of capital gains, as selling investments can result in taxable events.
   - **Diversification:** They can be a good place for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, consider maxing out an IRA (especially if itâ€™s a Roth) for the tax benefits.
- **Fill Up the 401(k):** Once the IRA is maxed, go back to increase your 401(k) contributions.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for your taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### Final Considerations:
- **Revisit Your Allocation:** Regularly reassess your investments and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice considering your specific situation.

By diversifying across these accounts, you can optimize your tax strategy and investment growth over time.
