To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should generally hold investments that are subject to less capital gains tax. For example, holding stocks with a long-term horizon or tax-efficient funds can be beneficial.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts delay taxes until withdrawal, making them suitable for higher income investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where the growth is tax-deferred, and more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax liabilities. Understanding the tax implications of each account type is crucial for this.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Monitor your portfolio and financial situation annually, adjusting contributions as income or financial goals change.

### 6. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency, investment growth, and risk management.
