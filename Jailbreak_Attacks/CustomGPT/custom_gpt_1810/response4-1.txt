Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out contributions if possible, especially if your income allows for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA.
   - **Diversification:** Consider different types of investments within your IRA to balance growth and risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals, making them useful for mid-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Growth Strategy:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with the 401(k) match, then max out an IRA, and finally add to taxable accounts.
- **Assess Your Goals:** Define short-term vs. long-term goals to decide how much to hold in taxable versus retirement accounts.
- **Rebalance Annually:** Review your allocations and rebalance to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### Consider Consulting a Professional:
Given individual circumstances, it's beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance that considers your financial situation and future goals.
