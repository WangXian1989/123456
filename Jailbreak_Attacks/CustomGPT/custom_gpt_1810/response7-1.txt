Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, financial goals, and current tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.
- **Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). Prioritize contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
- **Traditional vs. Roth:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals). Your current and expected future tax rates should guide your decision.
- **Annual Limits:** The contribution limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). Max out contributions if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments that are taxed favorably, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Guidelines**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating excess funds to investments.
- **Diversification:** Aim for a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consideration of Tax Implications**
- **Tax Bracket:** Be mindful of your tax bracket when withdrawing from accounts—this is especially crucial for retirement planning.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when to withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement, focusing on minimizing tax liability.

### Example Distribution
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing it out if you can.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum annual limit next, prioritizing either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on taxes.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional savings into taxable accounts, particularly for short- to medium-term goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation and goals.
