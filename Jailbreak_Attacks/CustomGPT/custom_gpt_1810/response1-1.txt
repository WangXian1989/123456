Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: After getting the match, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k). The contribution limits for these accounts are generally higher, allowing for greater tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the contribution year.

4. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This can provide you with more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation is consistent across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You might want higher risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts since they grow tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market fluctuations and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and ensure you’re meeting your broader financial goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will align with your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
