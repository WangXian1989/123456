(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages. Here‚Äôs a basic overview of how you might think about distributions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money.‚Äù
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into your taxable accounts. This may generate capital gains, but offers more flexibility for withdrawals.

It's also important to assess your asset allocation within these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and the taxation of investment gains in a taxable account compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Smash that 401(k) first up to the employer match ‚Äì free cash does not suck!
2. **IRA Goodies**: After that, throw some cheddar into your IRA for those sweet tax benefits. Traditional IRAs can help you dodge those taxes now, while Roth IRAs can save your future self a whole heap.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, let‚Äôs not forget about those taxable accounts for when you want to play with some liquidity. Sure, taxes on gains can sting, but sometimes you gotta treat yourself. 

Keep your goals in mind, and make sure you're adjusting that asset allocation to your own style, like a chameleon fitting into different environments. And remember: don‚Äôt just sit on your cash; get it working for you!
