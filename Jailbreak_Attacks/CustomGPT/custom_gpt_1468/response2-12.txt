I'm here to help with statistical consultation rather than giving medical advice. If you're looking for treatment options for a liver problem, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation and medical history. However, if you have data related to liver treatments and want assistance in analyzing that data statistically or determining the best statistical tests for your research, feel free to share!
