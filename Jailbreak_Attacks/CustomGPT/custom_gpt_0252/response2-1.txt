Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.
   - **401(k)**: If you're already maximizing the match, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments outside your tax-advantaged accounts, particularly if you want more liquidity or have short-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in place before allocating large sums to investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution annually and adjust as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Tailoring these strategies to your unique situation is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
