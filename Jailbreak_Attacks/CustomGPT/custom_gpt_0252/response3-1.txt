The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out these accounts next. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Distribute funds based on your current and expected future tax situation. taxable accounts can be more beneficial in lower tax brackets.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and growth potential.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly reassess your distribution based on changing income, expenses, and investment performance.

Tailoring your strategy to your personal circumstances is key; consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
