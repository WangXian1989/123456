Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

### 2. **Consider Growth Potential:**
   - **Long-Term Growth (e.g., stocks):** Favor these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Assets:** These can be placed in taxable accounts, where tax treatment may be more favorable on dividends.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Efficiency:** Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund separately, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure overall diversification across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, or life events.

### Sample Distribution: 
- **401(k):** 10-15% of income (to max employer match)
- **IRA:** Max contribution if possible (check limits)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds for additional investing or expenses

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to align distributions with your specific circumstances.
