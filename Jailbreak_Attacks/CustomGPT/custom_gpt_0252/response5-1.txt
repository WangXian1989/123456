Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors: your current tax rate, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed. The contribution limits are typically higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though you’ll pay capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of each account type. Tax-deferred accounts are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, while Roth accounts are advantageous if you expect to be in a higher bracket.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified to mitigate risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide tailored strategies that fit your specific circumstances.
