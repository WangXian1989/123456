To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). For the 2024 tax year, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on high-growth investments since withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **IRA**: If it's a Roth IRA, opt for investments you expect to grow significantly, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prioritize capital protection.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of how withdrawals from different accounts will affect your tax situation. 

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient liquidity in a savings account for emergencies, separate from your investment accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
