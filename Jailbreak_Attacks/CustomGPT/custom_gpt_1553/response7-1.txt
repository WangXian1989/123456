Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Familiarize yourself with annual contribution limits ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, and $30,000 for those 50 and older).
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose a diversified mix of investments aligned with your risk tolerance. Generally, a mix of stocks and bonds is advisable based on your time horizon.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Eligibility and Limits:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for your situation. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options:** IRAs often have broader investment options than 401(k)s. Choose investments that fit your long-term strategy.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use this type of account for funds you might need before retirement. They do not have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs), as capital gains taxes will impact your returns.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals:** Be mindful when withdrawing from these accounts, as you’ll be taxed on capital gains.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:** Max out 401(k) contributions, especially to capture the full employer match. Then, consider maxing out IRA contributions.
- **Build an emergency fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have enough liquidity in a savings account for emergencies.
- **Regularly rebalance:** Monitor and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and the tax implications of each account type. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
