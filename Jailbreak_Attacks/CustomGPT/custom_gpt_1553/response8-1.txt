Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Consider contributing to these accounts first if you want to reduce your taxable income. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for investing in tax-efficient funds or investments you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks may dominate in growth-oriented accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs), while you could consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure that you maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals and Compatibility**
   - Plan for optimal tax implications when you start withdrawing funds. Understand the rules regarding penalties and taxes on each account type.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexity and personal nature of investments, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies specific to your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
