I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver problems. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can support liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the stress on your liver.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

3. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding certain medications and substances that can harm the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and catch any issues early.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
