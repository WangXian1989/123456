Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Take advantage of tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Diversification**: Consider a mix of Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and Roth IRA (tax-free growth) depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Contribution Limits**: Use IRAs for additional retirement savings after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The limits are lower than 401(k), so be strategic about contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement, since IRAs and 401(k)s have withdrawal restrictions.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs due to their tax advantages.
- **Allocate According to Goals**: Split remaining investments for short- to medium-term goals in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
