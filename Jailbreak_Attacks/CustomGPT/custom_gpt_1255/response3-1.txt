Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute Beyond the Match in 401(k)**
   - After maxing your IRA, funnel additional savings into your 401(k), especially if your income allows higher contributions.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to access funds without penalties. Use them for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - Consider the tax impact of your distributions. Taxable accounts can result in capital gains taxes, whereas funds in retirement accounts grow tax-free until withdrawal.

### 6. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts, but remember that tax-advantaged accounts can be used for higher-growth investments.

### 7. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.
