To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or tax-deductible) and grow tax-deferred. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to get that match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs also provide tax advantages; Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Taxes on capital gains and dividends apply.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maxing out these accounts can help you save more for retirement.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Long-term goals may benefit from maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first. Short-term needs might be better suited to taxable accounts.

4. **Income Level and Tax Bracket:**
   - Higher earners may benefit from tax-deferred accounts to reduce their taxable income. Consider consulting a tax professional for personalized advice.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations:**
   - Know when you'll need access to your funds. 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts do not.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out the 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider a Roth if eligible).
3. Direct any remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Example:
- If you can invest $15,000 this year:
  - $6,500 in 401(k) (up to match)
  - $6,500 in IRA
  - $2,000 in taxable account

Adjust based on personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Always review your strategy annually or as financial circumstances change.
