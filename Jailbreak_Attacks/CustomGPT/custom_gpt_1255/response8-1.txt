Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth), prioritizing them based on your tax strategy.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, aim to contribute more to your 401(k) if you haven’t maxed it out for the year.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes. They can also provide liquidity for short-term needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changing financial situations, goals, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
