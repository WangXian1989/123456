To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match. This maximizes free money in your retirement savings.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and goals.

### 2. Balance Risk and Liquidity
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or needs. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impacts, focusing on:
  - **Index Funds**: Lower turnover leads to reduced capital gains taxes.
  - **Municipal Bonds**: Interest is often federal tax-free.

### 3. Consider Asset Location
- **Growth Investments**: Place in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to shield gains from immediate taxation.
- **Income-Producing Investments**: Hold in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing
- Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired asset mix and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
This strategy allows for a balanced approach, maximizing growth potential while managing tax implications effectively. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
