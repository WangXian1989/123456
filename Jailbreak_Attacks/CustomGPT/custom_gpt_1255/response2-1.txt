Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - For tax-deferred growth, consider contributing the maximum limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you're eligible, max out your IRA contributions for more tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in more tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or as a source of liquidity.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Short-term goals**: Focus on taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Medium-term goals**: Prioritize IRA contributions for tax benefits.
- **Long-term goals**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for growth.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket.
- **Age**: Younger investors might favor growth-oriented accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift towards more conservative investments.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.
