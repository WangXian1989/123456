(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax benefits. Consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility.

Keep in mind your overall asset allocation and risk tolerance when deciding how much to invest in each type of account.

Your 401(k) is like that responsible friend who saves for retirement while getting a match from the employer. Go ahead and stuff as much in there as you canâ€”at least up to the match!

Next, swing over to your IRA, where you can get either a tax break now or talk about your future retirement funds tax-free. If you can, max that out too. Finally, once youâ€™ve hit those retirement goals, you can play around with taxable accounts like itâ€™s your after-partyâ€”youâ€™ve got flexibility to pull cash when you need it, but keep an eye on those taxes! Just remember, balance is keyâ€”donâ€™t let one account dominate, and diversify wisely!
