Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Taxation on Gains**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or taxable income, such as individual stocks or certain bonds. Prefer holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more to equities if you have a higher risk tolerance, especially in tax-advantaged accounts. For safer investments (like bonds), consider placing them in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you're diversified across various asset classes in all accounts.

### 4. **Debt Consideration**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider prioritizing paying that down before investing heavily in these accounts.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline**
   - Closer to retirement? Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 6. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Review your investment allocation at least annually and adjust based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your personal circumstances.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (max out if possible)
- **IRA:** $6,500-$7,500 (if eligible, depending on age)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on personal financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your situation.
