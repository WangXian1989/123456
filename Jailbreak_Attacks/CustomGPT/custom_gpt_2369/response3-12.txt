I'm not a doctor, but it's important to discuss liver problems with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe specific medications.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases (like liver cirrhosis or tumors), surgical options or a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may find benefits from herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a doctor as they can interact with medications.

Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
