Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Individual retirement account, typically providing tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. Investment gains are taxed when you sell, and dividends are also taxable.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Fill Up 401(k):** After capturing the match and maxing your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Higher-income earners may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) to lower taxable income now.
   - **Future Tax Rates:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions. If you anticipate being in the same or higher bracket, consider Roth accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Align your investments in these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term growth may warrant a higher allocation to equities.
   - **Asset Location:** Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds) or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Review Your Overall Portfolio**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall investment portfolio maintains diversification across asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, helping optimize your portfolio’s performance.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 40% (max out to capture match)
- **IRA:** 30% (favoring Roth if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% (for more flexible access and potential income needs)

### Final Thoughts
Balancing contributions requires a holistic view of your financial situation, income needs, and future goals. Regularly reassess and adjust as necessary to stay on track with your retirement planning.
