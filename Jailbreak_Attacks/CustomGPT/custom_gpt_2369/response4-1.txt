Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a concise strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, typically around 5-6% of your salary.
   - **Benefit:** This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Type:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Limit:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Benefit:** This helps in tax diversification for retirement.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - **Utilization:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Investment Type:** Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Considering Tax Bracket**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Favorable if you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Age Considerations**
   - **Younger Investors:** Lean towards more aggressive investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards conservative investments as you approach retirement to preserve capital.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - **Allocate Investments** across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk and grow wealth.

### Regular Review
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your salary (up to the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds after maxing other accounts

This strategy aligns with both short-term liquidity needs and long-term retirement goals. For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.
