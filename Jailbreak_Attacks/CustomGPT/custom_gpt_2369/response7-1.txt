Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full match**. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions.

### 3. **Allocate Excess Funds**
   - After maximizing match contributions and IRAs, use any additional funds for your 401(k). 
   - If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA options, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on investing in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) for high-growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Those are suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 5. **Risk Management**
   - Assess your overall portfolio across all accounts to ensure proper diversification and risk management according to your investment strategy.

### 6. **Regular Reviews**
   - Periodically review your allocation to adapt to changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Example Allocation
1. **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary (max out if possible).
2. **IRA**: Up to the annual contribution limit ($6,500 for those under 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate additional funds based on your immediate financial needs or opportunities.

### Conclusion
A combination of strategies tailored to your specific situation will yield the best results. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to refine your distribution strategy.
