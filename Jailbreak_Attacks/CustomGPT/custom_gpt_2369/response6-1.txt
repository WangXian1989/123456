Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA can provide tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals. These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalty.
   - **Manage Capital Gains**: Be mindful of how investments are allocated in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - **Asset Allocation Across Accounts**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to hold more aggressive assets (like stocks) in accounts where growth is prioritized (401(k) and IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax exposure.

### 4. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - **Adjust Based on Changing Needs**: As your financial situation, tax laws, and goals change, regularly reassess your distribution strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It can be beneficial to work with a professional to tailor a distribution strategy that considers your entire financial picture.

### Summary
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first** (401(k) > IRA).
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility** and manage tax implications.
- **Diversify investments** based on risk tolerance and goals. 

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage your money across different accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
