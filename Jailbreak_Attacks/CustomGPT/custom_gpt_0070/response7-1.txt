Investing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic allocation based on factors like tax implications, investment goals, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - **IRA:** Next, consider funding an IRA (traditional or Roth). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50+). 

### 2. **Consider Taxation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of how investments are taxed. For example, long-term capital gains (held over a year) have favorable rates compared to short-term gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth. Consider a mix of equities (stocks) for higher growth potential and fixed income for stability.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be strategic with your investments to minimize taxes. Favor tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs, and hold bonds in retirement accounts to avoid high tax rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

### Summary
- Prioritize contribution to your 401(k) for matching.
- Fund your IRA next, then invest in taxable accounts.
- Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
