To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; may have employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth); contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay down any high-interest debt.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains tax; consider holding investments long-term.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can grow well in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider bonds or more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses in cash or liquid savings before investing heavily.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to adapt to life changes and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to match, then max out Roth IRA.
- **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize Roth; otherwise, contribute to traditional up to the limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after funding retirement accounts.
