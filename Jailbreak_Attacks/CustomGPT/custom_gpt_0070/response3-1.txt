Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Here are some key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds. Consider maxing out your employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Prioritize lower-tax investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 2. **Retirement Goals**
   - Assess how much you plan to spend in retirement and adjust contributions accordingly to ensure sufficient funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize investments in these accounts since they have tax advantages. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient. Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable gains.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (2023) for those under 50, with an additional $7,500 for those 50 and older.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (2023) for those under 50, with an additional $1,000 for those 50 and older.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, youâ€™d draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit first.
- **Fully Fund IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit if you can.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Reviews
- Reassess your distribution annually to adjust for changes in tax laws, investment performance, and personal circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
