Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **Start with your 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA next, focusing on the tax benefits (tax-deferred growth for Traditional, tax-free growth for Roth).

### 3. **Fill Up Your 401(k)**
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting excess funds into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and timeline.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Check-Ins:** Periodically review your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Conclusion
Assess your individual circumstances, including age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance, to tailor this strategy for your needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
