Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting your taxable income differently.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when you sell.

### 3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure high-interest debts (like credit cards) are paid off.

### 4. **Use the Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Focus on maxing out contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they grow tax-deferred or tax-free, reducing your tax burden.

### 5. **Diversification Across Account Types**
   - Keep a balanced approach:
     - **401(k):** Often has limited investment choices; choose diversified mutual funds or ETFs.
     - **IRA:** Offers more flexibility; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds based on your risk tolerance.
     - **Taxable Account:** Use for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - Younger individuals might favor more aggressive growth investments, while those nearing retirement could shift towards more conservative options.

### 7. **Review Annually**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice fitting your specific financial situation and goals.

This blend aims for long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider your current and future financial situations when allocating funds.
