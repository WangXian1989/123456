It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems, as treatment options can vary widely based on the specific condition, its severity, and individual health factors. Generally, treatment options might include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver, cirrhosis), medications may help manage symptoms or fight infection.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and reducing alcohol intake can improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests to assess progression or improvement.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Discuss with your doctor about any alternative therapies that are safe and effective.

Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider to discuss your specific situation and the best course of action.
