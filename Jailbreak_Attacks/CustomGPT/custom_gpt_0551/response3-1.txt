Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Roths may provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed differently. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell, which can be beneficial if you hold investments long-term.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before aggressively investing.

4. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it down before investing heavily.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix based on how much risk you’re willing to take. Younger investors typically can afford to take more risks than those nearing retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider when you’ll need to access the money. Generally, it’s wise to:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first, as they have the least favorable tax treatment.
   - Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts next (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally, from tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your investment distribution based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance and help you develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your goals and circumstances.
