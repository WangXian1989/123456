Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). IRAs typically provide more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits on contributions but with potential income limits affecting deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax benefits; however, you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates, which are often lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your overall investment strategy, taking into account your risk tolerance. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of retirement. Generally, it might make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to manage taxes) and defer tax-deferred accounts until necessary.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
