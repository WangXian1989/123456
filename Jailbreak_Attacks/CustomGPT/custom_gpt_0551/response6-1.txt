Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund IRA:** Depending on your income, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
  
### 2. Tax Considerations
   - **Consider Tax Brackets:** If you're in a higher tax bracket currently, prioritize traditional accounts for the tax break; switch to Roth accounts if you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement without penalties.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts for potential favorable tax treatment on qualified dividends.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing
   - **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess your allocations to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.
   - **Consider Market Conditions:** Adjust asset distributions based on market performance or changes in financial goals.

### 5. Emergency Fund
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to avoid tapping into retirement accounts for unforeseen expenses.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, your optimal allocation will depend on individual circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial picture.
