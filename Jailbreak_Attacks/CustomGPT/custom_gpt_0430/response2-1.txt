Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with a company match. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual Retirement Accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. These offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term savings.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and less restrictive withdrawal options.

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first – it’s free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Account**: After maxing retirement account contributions, use any additional funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs).

### 4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: A mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts allows flexibility in managing your tax bill during retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Strategy**: Place investments with high expected growth in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

### 5. **Investment Choices**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, longer-term investments can afford more risk.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changes in financial goals, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: 20% of total savings (maxed out to employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 20% (max contributions)
- **Taxable Account**: 60% (for further investments and liquidity)
