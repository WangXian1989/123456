Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money. Contribute to the limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they are taxed at lower rates. Use this account for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This could mean different asset allocations in your tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts based on when you plan to access the funds.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments, as they can compound tax-free or tax-deferred. Consider lower growth, more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your allocations across all accounts periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments (e.g., bonds, stable funds) to preserve capital. If you're younger, you may opt for a growth-oriented approach.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy that considers your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Make sure to adapt your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve over time.
