Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be better for short-term savings or investments you plan to withdraw within a few years, as they offer more liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Balance your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Look at modifying your asset allocation to include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each, considering the tax implications of each account type.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Immediate Contributions**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first. Typically, aim for:
  - 15-20% of income in the 401(k).
  - Up to the IRA contribution limit if eligible.
- **After Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are:
  - Long-term.
  - Likely to yield low annual returns (e.g., municipal bonds).

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
