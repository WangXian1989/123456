Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowable amount. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax-free contributions or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investment contributions after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. This may be beneficial for shorter-term goals, as these accounts provide liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to have a more aggressive portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts (where investments can grow tax-deferred or tax-free) and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically (annually or more frequently if needed) to ensure they still align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation. 

Each person's situation is unique, so it might be beneficial to adjust these strategies based on your specific financial circumstances and goals.
