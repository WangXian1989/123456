To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to these accounts first, as they offer tax advantages. Contributions to a 401(k) may reduce your taxable income, while IRAs can grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider placing investments with higher growth potential or those you plan to hold for a long time here.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments according to your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. Typically, riskier assets (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit more from tax deferral. In taxable accounts, consider holding more stable investments like bonds that generate interest.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Planning**:
   - Consider your anticipated income needs in retirement. If you expect to withdraw significantly from your taxable accounts first, ensure those accounts are suitably funded. Withdrawals from retirement accounts can be impacted by taxes and penalties, whereas taxable account withdrawals may not carry the same implications.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment goals. Rebalance to maintain your desired risk level across all account types.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide insights tailored to your unique financial situation and help optimize your overall asset allocation strategy.

By prioritizing tax efficiency, maximizing contributions, and aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of assets across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
