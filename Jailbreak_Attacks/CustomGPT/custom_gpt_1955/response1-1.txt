When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   
2. **Tax Advantages:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or Roth IRAs. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed differently compared to tax-advantaged accounts. Plan your distributions based on your current and expected future tax bracket.

5. **Emergency Savings:** Don't forget to maintain some liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, a financial advisor can tailor advice to your specific situation, helping you optimize your strategy for retirement. 

Be sure to periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changing market conditions and life circumstances.
