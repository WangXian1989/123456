To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**  
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money!  
   - Invest in a Roth IRA (or traditional IRA) for tax-free (or tax-deferred) growth.

2. **Allocate for Flexibility and Accessibility:**  
   - Utilize taxable accounts for funds needed in the short term, as they offer easier access without withdrawal penalties.  
   - Maintain a balance that allows for both long-term growth and short-term liquidity needs.

Always consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when making decisions. Safe when used as directed!
