Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general steps to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand that investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but they require after-tax contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while income-generating assets might be more beneficial in taxable accounts due to preferential tax rates.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide tax flexibility. For instance, you may withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer, or strategically withdraw from Roth accounts for tax-free income later.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

This approach provides a solid foundation for effectively distributing your money across accounts, ensuring you're prepared for both growth and tax efficiency in the long term.
