The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer's match first, as it's essentially free money. Then, contribute enough to reach the annual contribution limit, if possible. The 401(k) often offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you prefer traditional tax benefits now, an IRA might be more suitable. Aim to maximize your contributions to capitalize on tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any savings goals you have that are shorter-term, such as buying a home or funding education. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Prioritization**: Generally, prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable ones to maximize tax efficiency. Once you’ve captured any employer match and maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, then you can funnel additional funds into taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to develop a plan tailored specifically to your unique financial situation.
