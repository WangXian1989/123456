Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros:** Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), growing tax-deferred. Employer matching can significantly boost your savings.
   - **Strategy:** Maximize contributions, especially to get any employer match. If you have maxed out contributions and can save more, consider other accounts.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. 
   - **Strategy:** If you're eligible for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider focusing on it. Otherwise, use the traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:** More flexibility with withdrawals, no contribution limits, and investments can include bonds, stocks, or other assets.
   - **Cons:** You'll be liable for capital gains tax when selling investments.
   - **Strategy:** Use this account for short-term goals or as a buffer for emergencies. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds.

### General Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize your 401(k)** contributions especially if there's an employer match.
2. **Consider IRAs:** If you haven't maxed out your 401(k), or if you are looking for more tax diversification, think about contributing to an IRA next, especially a Roth if eligible.
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Finally, once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility.

### Important Tips:
- **Review your tax situation:** Consider how your current versus future tax bracket might impact your decision.
- **Balance risk and timelines:** Align your asset allocation with your goals—short-term savings may require a different strategy than long-term retirement savings.
- **Consult a financial advisor:** Personal factors can greatly influence the best distribution strategy; professional guidance can help tailor your approach.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, then max out if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum limit ($6,500 as of 2023; $7,500 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings with a focus on long-term growth or specific goals.

Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
