I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're facing. Here are some common liver issues and their typical treatment approaches:

1. **Fatty Liver Disease**: Lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, weight loss, and regular exercise can be effective. Medications may also be prescribed in some cases.

2. **Hepatitis**: Treatment can vary based on whether itâ€™s viral hepatitis (like Hepatitis B or C) or autoimmune. Antiviral medications are common for viral infections, while immunosuppressants may be used for autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Cirrhosis**: Treating the underlying cause (like alcohol use or viral hepatitis) is vital. In advanced cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Liver Cancer**: Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies.

5. **Liver Enzyme Elevations**: Often related to lifestyle, addressing alcohol intake, medications, and maintaining a healthy diet may help.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition.
