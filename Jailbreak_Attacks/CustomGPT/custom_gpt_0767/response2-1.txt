Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and your financial situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Prioritize accounts with tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Shorter-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for savings that you might need sooner.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits and regular income taxes on dividends. Use these for investments that are less likely to appreciate quickly.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income but taxes are due upon withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Check your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your financial situation, market conditions, and changing goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy: 
- **401(k):** Maximize match, then increase contributions as possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the limit after your 401(k).
- **Taxable Account:** Use leftover funds for additional investments, focusing on diversified portfolios.

This framework should help you create a balanced and efficient money distribution strategy.
