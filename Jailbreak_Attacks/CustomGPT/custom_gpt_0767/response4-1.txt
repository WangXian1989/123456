The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, with a catch-up option for those over 50).
   - **Investment Choices:** Review the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable events, like stocks or real estate, where you may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - You might want to consider your asset allocation across these accounts collectively rather than in isolation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications for retirement. Typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically assess your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
