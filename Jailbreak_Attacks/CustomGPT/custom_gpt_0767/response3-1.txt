Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
- **401(k):** Often includes employer matching contributions, which can significantly boost your retirement savings. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity. However, investment gains are taxed annually, which can affect long-term growth.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
- Aim to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take full advantage of matching contributions.
- After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you qualify for the tax benefits associated with traditional or Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
- Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends, long-term capital gains, or tax-exempt bonds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
- Diversify your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks offer higher growth potential, while bonds provide stability.
- Keep in mind the overall balance of your investments across all accounts, not just within a single account.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
- Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and your evolving financial situation, ensuring you remain aligned with your retirement goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your individual circumstances.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to the 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, allocate any additional investments to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This structured approach will help ensure youâ€™re strategically maximizing your contributions while considering the implications of taxes and investment growth.
