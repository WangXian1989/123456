Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts relies on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investments available in each account. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement. These are usually ideal for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. It can be beneficial to contribute here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and can be beneficial for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment profits.

3. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and IRA. If they have higher fees or limited options, it may be better to prioritize your taxable account for investments of your choice.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a more liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-term Strategy**: Consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. A balanced approach might look like maximizing the 401(k) for the match, funding a Roth IRA if eligible, and then investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

6. **Reevaluate Periodically**: As your financial situation and market conditions change, regularly reassess your allocation strategy. 

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your unique circumstances.
