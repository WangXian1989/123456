To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for at least 15% of your salary if you can afford it.

2. **Prioritize Debt Payoff**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down before investing heavily. The interest on debt can often outweigh investment returns.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs generally offer tax advantages that can enhance your retirement savings.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts. Stocks and index funds tend to be more tax-friendly compared to bonds, which can yield taxed income.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio by holding a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor your investment allocations periodically and rebalance to maintain your intended asset allocation. This may mean shifting funds between accounts as needed.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your income, decide if Roth contributions (after-tax) or traditional (pre-tax) are more advantageous for your 401(k) or IRA.

8. **Long-Term Planning**: Focus on long-term growth in your accounts. Adjust allocations based on time horizon and retirement goals.

By balancing contributions according to these principles, you can optimize your financial growth while managing risk and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
