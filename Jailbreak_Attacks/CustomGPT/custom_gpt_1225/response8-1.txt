Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 for those aged 50 and over).
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diverse mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider the tax implications. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those aged 50 and over). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: You can invest in a variety of assets, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any earnings when you sell investments.

**Suggested Strategy**:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your employer-sponsored 401(k) to maximize the match, then contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Any additional savings can go into a taxable account for more flexible withdrawal options.
- **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and your financial situation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
