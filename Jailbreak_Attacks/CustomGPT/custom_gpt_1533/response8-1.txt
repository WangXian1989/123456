To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth options) and grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing, as the interest rates can often exceed potential investment gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Retirement Goals**: Align your investments based on when you plan to retire. If you're younger, a more aggressive portfolio may be suitable; as you approach retirement, consider a more conservative approach.

7. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds).
   - Consider the implications of capital gains tax on taxable accounts when making trades.

8. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
