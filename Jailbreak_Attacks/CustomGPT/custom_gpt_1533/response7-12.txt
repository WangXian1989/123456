1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit fatty foods.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying issues (like hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
