Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should typically be lower-risk, income-generating investments. Use them for investments that may incur capital gains taxes when sold.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Often limited to specific funds. Choose investments with good growth potential, like index funds or target-date funds aligned with your time horizon.
   - **IRA:** Offers more investment options. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and looser investment vehicles based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversify Your Portfolio**
   - Maintain a balanced mix across all accounts based on investment strategy (stock vs. bond allocation) rather than strictly by account type.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Goals**
   - Adjust your allocations based on life changes (e.g., income level, retirement age, etc.) and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **Contribute to 401(k)**: 15% up to the match.
2. **Fund IRA**: Contribute the maximum ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Use Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds here, focusing on diversified investments.

### Conclusion
Choose a strategy that aligns with your long-term goals and adjust based on performance and changing financial situations. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
