Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, pre-tax contributions (or Roth options), potentially with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account, can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments outside of retirement accounts, subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA) allow your investments to grow without immediate taxation, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Roth accounts** (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts** allow for more flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match.
   - Consider maxing out **IRA** contributions if possible, especially Roth IRAs if eligible.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maximizing tax-advantaged options.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on age, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly Roth accounts for tax efficiency.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Max out 401(k)** contributions (especially to get the match).
- **Max out IRA** contributions (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
- Use any remaining funds for a **taxable account** for liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion
The best strategy varies by individual circumstances, so it may be wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific needs.
