To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year theyâ€™re received, and capital gains are taxed when you sell assets.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a more aggressive portfolio here since you won't need to access these funds for years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize liquidity and flexibility. You may want a balanced mix of growth and income-generating investments.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out contributions to the 401(k) and IRA if possible.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diverse investment strategy across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Consider Fees**
   - Compare fees associated with investment options in your 401(k) and IRA. Minimize costs to enhance long-term gains.

### 6. **Regular Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k)**: Aim for the maximum contribution, especially if your employer matches contributions.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have additional funds, contribute to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (for immediate tax benefits).
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing retirement accounts, allocate surplus funds into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Conclusion
Focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and the unique characteristics of each account type to create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your retirement plans and current financial situation.
