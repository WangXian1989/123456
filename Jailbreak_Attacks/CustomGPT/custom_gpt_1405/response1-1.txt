Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income.
   - Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money – it's beneficial to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you’re close to retirement and have caught up on other savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k), but with potential tax deductions depending on income and participation in an employer plan.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Depending on your income, it might be beneficial to balance contributions between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These are flexible and can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them ideal for shorter-term goals or emergency savings.
   - Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your regular income tax rate, whereas long-term capital gains have a lower tax rate.
   - Consider using these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for longer-term investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Important:
Tailor your distribution strategy to your personal financial situation and consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan. This guidance can consider your current income, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
