Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth. If you haven't reached the match but are maxing out your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to achieve the match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider the tax-free withdrawal benefit in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Fund this account if you qualify because withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) or when you have maxed out all tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind the tax implications of dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities) to reduce risk.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Funds in retirement accounts are less accessible without penalties than those in taxable accounts. Ensure you have enough liquid assets for emergencies.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Assess your asset allocation periodically (at least annually) and adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in income, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary greatly, so it may be beneficial to meet with a financial advisor to craft a strategy tailored to your specific goals and needs.

Implementing a well-thought-out strategy can lead to long-term financial success and stability.
