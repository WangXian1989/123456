(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA first, as they often provide tax benefits such as deferred taxes on contributions and earnings. You might consider maxing out contributions to your employer's 401(k) to benefit from any matching contributions before contributing to an IRA. After maximizing these, you can then allocate funds to your taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds without early withdrawal penalties. It's also wise to diversify your investments across these accounts based on your overall asset allocation strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your approach to your unique situation.

Then, consider maxing out your IRA since it gives you those sweet tax benefits too. Once you've got those covered, it's time to load up your taxable account. Why? Because it's like the wild westâ€”you can pull your money out without penalties and have the flexibility to invest in whatever the heck you want. Go for a mix of aggressive and conservative investments across the board to keep things spicy. But hey, always keep your eye on the market trends and maybe bring in a financial advisor for the really tricky stuff. Happy investing!
