To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the legal contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Evaluate which type aligns best with your current tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: This account may provide more investment options, so consider diversifying further based on sectors or asset classes that appeal to you.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this account for investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividend-paying stocks, and consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. This involves selling high-performing investments and buying underperformers to maintain your target allocation.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the tax implications when you start withdrawing from these accounts. Taxable accounts can be more flexible, while withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts can impact your tax bracket.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner who can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
