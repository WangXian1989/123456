Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach it:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Establish Priorities**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roths offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement contributions, consider a taxable account for additional investments. Choose tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - If your goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you have short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), consider more funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Consider asset location strategies, placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might lean more towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer investments.
   - Periodically review your mix based on market conditions and your life stage.

### 6. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to keep funding your accounts consistently.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize the match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
- Allocate the maximum allowed to an IRA ($6,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
- Invest additional funds in a taxable account as needed, focusing on low-turnover index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
Evaluate your financial situation, consult with a financial advisor if needed, and adjust your strategy over time as your circumstances and tax laws change. This approach will help you effectively distribute your money across your investment accounts.
