I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet modification**: A balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Regular exercise** to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Alternative Therapies:**
   - Some may explore herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss these options with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
