Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider High Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maximizing contributions to take full advantage.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Deduction**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. If you're above the income limits, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification in Taxes**: Having a mix of pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can give you flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for liquidity. Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start with contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then focus on maxing out your Roth or Traditional IRA.
- After fully utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts, prioritizing tax efficiency.

Regularly review your asset allocation based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
