To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to get your employer’s match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher contributions if possible**: If you can afford it, maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you want immediate tax benefits, go for a Traditional IRA.
   - **Max out annual contribution**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500 for 2023, plus an extra $1,000 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Strategic investing**: Utilize taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for long-term goals such as buying a house.
   - **Focus on tax-efficient investments**: Consider holding index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds, as these tend to generate less taxable income.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance regularly**: Adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Your Goals and Timeline**: Tailor your contributions and distribution based on your retirement goals and timeline. 

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation!
