Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). If possible, max out your contributions if your budget allows, as contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts should be used for investments that generate long-term capital gains or yield (like stocks) since they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income. Keep tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Consider holding various investments (stocks, bonds, REITs) in each account type to balance risk and returns. 

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (like a savings account) before committing excess funds to retirement accounts.

### 5. **Adjust for Your Age and Goals**
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily towards growth-oriented investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement may want to shift towards more stable, income-producing investments.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, maxing out employer match.
- **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Fund these with any extra savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short-term goals.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
- Review your investments annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Customize your allocation based on individual financial circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
