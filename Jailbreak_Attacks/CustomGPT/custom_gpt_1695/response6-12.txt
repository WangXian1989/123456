I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can recommend specific treatments based on your diagnosis. Common options might include:

- **Medication**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet alterations, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be considered.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
