To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, pay it down before heavily investing.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for short-term needs but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for growth-oriented investments (stocks).
   - Consider holding more stable investments (bonds, cash) in your taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure you stay aligned with your retirement goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you optimize your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts and considering tax efficiency, you'll set yourself up for better long-term financial health.
