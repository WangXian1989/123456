I can provide advice on how to distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on general principles.

### Considerations for Distribution:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but capital gains tax rates may be lower depending on your income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Long-term retirement goals could prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, allowing for more liquidity.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on how much risk youâ€™re willing to take in each account type.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits to avoid penalties.

### Suggested Approach:

1. Max out employer contributions in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or to maintain liquidity for short-term needs.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that aligns with your specific situation.
