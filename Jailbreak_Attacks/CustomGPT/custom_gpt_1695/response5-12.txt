I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the specific condition. Key aspects could involve:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and avoiding processed foods.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to track liver function through blood tests and imaging.
4. **Exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with your doctor to get the best guidance tailored to your situation.
