The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You have the option of a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. 
   - With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. The tax-deferred growth is beneficial, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investment accounts for additional savings. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Assess your investment strategy and risk tolerance across all accounts. Ensure your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your goals.
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or 401(k).

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be aware of how withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts will affect your tax situation in retirement. Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes.
   - Regularly review your tax situation and adjust contributions accordingly to optimize your taxation over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Finally, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember that these are general guidelines, and individual circumstances may vary significantly. It's important to tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation.
