(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you may want to consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: After securing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping in mind the different tax implications (e.g., holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts).

5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your investment strategy periodically and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

3. **Flex with Taxable**: Once youâ€™re fueled up on tax perks, itâ€™s time to play with your taxable accounts. These bad boys give you flexibility and cash flow whenever you want. You can throw in some fun stocks or whatever tickles your fancy!
