I'm not a medical professional, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, but they can include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced procedures like liver transplantation. Always seek professional medical advice for health-related concerns.
