I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.

Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or treat the underlying cause.
  
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the progression of liver disease.
  
4. **Surgery or Transplant**: In severe cases, surgery or a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and a treatment plan tailored to your situation.
