When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to maximize that match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Focus on maxing out your contributions (the limit is $20,500 for individuals under 50 and $27,000 for those 50 and over for 2023).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA (the limit is $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and over for 2023). Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean more towards Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA), as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - If you’re currently in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) may be beneficial now to lower your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held outside retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a qualified financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Implementing these strategies can help maximize your savings and enhance your long-term wealth.
