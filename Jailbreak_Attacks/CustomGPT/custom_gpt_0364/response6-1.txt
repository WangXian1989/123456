To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limits and employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Be aware of both traditional and Roth IRA limits, especially if you are above the income thresholds for Roth contributions.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, so growth can be slower due to taxes.

Consider your individual retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment preferences. 

What is your current risk tolerance or investment strategy?
