To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, including earnings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can minimize taxes.

2. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (like 401(k) and IRAs) before investing in taxable accounts.
   - Consider your investment time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments can handle volatility.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts have annual contribution limits. Make sure to maximize contributions to the extent that matches your financial goals.
   - Monitor any employer matching contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of "free money".

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, it may be prudent to be more conservative with your asset allocation, ensuring you have enough liquid assets available.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have adequate emergency savings before committing excessive funds to retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk effectively.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house, education).

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer matches.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth.
- Fill any remaining funds into your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
