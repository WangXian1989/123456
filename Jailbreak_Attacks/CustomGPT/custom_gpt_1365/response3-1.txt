To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Investment Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will influence how aggressively you invest across different accounts.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Choose based on your expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when you sell, so consider holding lower-turnover investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize tax-advantaged growth.

4. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it before making significant contributions to other accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and optimize returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your planned withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having taxable accounts can provide flexibility for managing tax implications in retirement.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

A common strategy is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s an employer match), then fund an IRA (preferably Roth for tax-free growth), and finally allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. 

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique financial situation.
