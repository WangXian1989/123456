I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for any liver-related issues. They can provide personalized and appropriate treatment options based on your specific condition, which may include lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies. If you have your medical records or symptoms to share, I can help guide you to general information related to liver health.
