Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax bracket, investment objectives, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, which can be advantageous if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed at withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits for IRAs and consider maxing out if you can.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer the most flexibility regarding withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals or other investments.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize the tax liability on capital gains and dividends.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, maximize your IRA contributions next, especially if you can afford to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees and good investment options.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Finally, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts for liquidity and short-term investments.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth investments, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on preservation and income.
- **Tax Planning**: Consider consulting with a tax advisor to optimize tax efficiency based on your specific situation.

Tailoring this strategy to fit your personal financial situation is key, so it's beneficial to revisit it periodically or when significant life changes occur.
