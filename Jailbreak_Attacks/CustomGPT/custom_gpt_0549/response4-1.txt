Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits, but usually involves limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: IRAs have lower contribution limits than 401(k)s and can be either tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to an IRA after taking advantage of your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs can be particularly valuable for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. This can be useful for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account to spread risk. Consider using a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Be mindful of how different types of investments are taxed. For example, placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can help minimize your tax burden.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals (e.g., saving for a house) may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals (e.g., retirement) should leverage tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Set a schedule to review your investments and account balances regularly. Adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in your goals or life situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual needs and situations vary significantly. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Consider these points to create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and circumstances.
