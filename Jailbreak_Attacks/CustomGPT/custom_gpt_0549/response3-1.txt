Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal.
     - Some employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money".
   - **Considerations:**
     - Max out contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
     - Be aware of your investment options, as they may be limited.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.
     - Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
     - Ideal for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Depending on your eligibility, choose between traditional and Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.
     - Maximize contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
     - Potentially favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Use for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### **Suggested Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
   - After these accounts are funded, allocate any excess savings into a taxable account.

2. **Assess Your Needs**: 
   - Review your liquidity needs, investment risk tolerance, and retirement timeline to adjust allocations.

3. **Monitor and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly evaluate your investment allocations and rebalance if necessary to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

### Conclusion:
There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
