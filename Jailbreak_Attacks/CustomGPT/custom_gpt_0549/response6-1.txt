Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before anything else. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on putting your higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to potentially benefit from compound growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like municipal bonds or long-term capital gains) and for liquidity needs.

### 3. **Retirement Income Strategy**
   - **Withdrawal Order**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Use taxable accounts first for flexibility, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize your tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Revisit your allocation yearly or with significant life changes to ensure your strategy aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, considering the implications of different account types, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can maximize your investment growth and minimize future tax liabilities.
