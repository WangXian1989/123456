Itâ€™s important to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your individual situation. However, here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Often have employer matching; prioritize contributions to get the full match first. Consider your investment choices and fees.
   
2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Both types have tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while Traditional contributions may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term savings goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when investing.

A balanced approach could involve maxing out employer matches in your 401(k), contributing to an IRA, and allocating additional funds to taxable accounts. Always consider your tax implications and investment time horizon.
