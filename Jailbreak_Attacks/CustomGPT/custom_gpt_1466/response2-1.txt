When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's often best to consider several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA and 401(k) before investing in taxable accounts. This can help you benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for both the 401(k) and IRA accounts. As of 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be ideal for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income, as long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, you may want to reduce risk in your 401(k) and IRA accounts, while your taxable account could hold more liquid assets that can be accessed without penalties.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial circumstances and tax laws change, so it's important to reassess your distribution strategy regularly.

It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.
