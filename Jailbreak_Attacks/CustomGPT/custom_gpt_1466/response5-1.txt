(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Generally, a good approach might involve prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) or IRA, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution on the 401(k). After maximizing these accounts, you can proceed to invest in taxable accounts.

You should also consider factors like the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account type, your current income level, and whether you expect your income to rise significantly in the future. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
