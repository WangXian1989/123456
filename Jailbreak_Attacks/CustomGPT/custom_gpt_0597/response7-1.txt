When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some guiding principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50) per year. Contributions to these accounts reduce your taxable income.

3. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Invest in a mix of accounts that offer different tax treatments. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are pre-tax and taxable upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before aggressively investing.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals or unexpected needs.

6. **Diversified Investment Strategy**: No matter which accounts you are funding, ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider a strategy for how you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it might be wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage your tax bracket.

Consulting with a financial planner can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
