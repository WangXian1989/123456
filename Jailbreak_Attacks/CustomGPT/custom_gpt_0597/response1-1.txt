To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 401(k)s (in 2023), you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if youâ€™re over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Ensure you're maximizing contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Consider your Tax Situation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Ideal for higher earners looking to reduce current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. This account offers flexibility and can be used for emergency funds or short-term goals.

3. **Review Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your risk tolerance and investment goals should shape your distribution strategy. Generally, longer-term goals can afford more aggressive investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within these accounts to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your allocation in line with your long-term goals and risk tolerance by regularly reviewing and adjusting your investments as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance can be very beneficial.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your retirement goals and current financial situation.
