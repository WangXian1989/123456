I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about common liver problem treatments. It's crucial to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and exercising regularly can help manage liver health. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options may be considered, such as liver transplantation.

5. **Supplements**: Some people take supplements like milk thistle, but always check with your doctor before starting any new supplement.

Always discuss your options with a healthcare professional for the best course of action tailored to your needs.
