Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can help optimize your tax situation and grow your wealth. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage tax impacts better.

4. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor your allocation and adjust based on market conditions, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and strategically placing assets, you can enhance your investment returns while minimizing taxes.
