To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out your IRA contributions next if applicable. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns, while holding tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement carefully. Typically, you’d withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
