I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function.
4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing diseases like hepatitis or fatty liver disease might be necessary.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be considered.

Always talk to your doctor for a personalized treatment plan.
