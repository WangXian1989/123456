I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modification and weight loss can help. A balanced diet low in fat and sugar is often recommended.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
