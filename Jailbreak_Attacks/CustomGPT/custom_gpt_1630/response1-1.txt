Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first; that's free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This can give you tax advantages depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts are great for saving for shorter-term goals or if you plan to access funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes—stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents—to manage risk.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changing financial situations, goals, and market performance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific needs.
