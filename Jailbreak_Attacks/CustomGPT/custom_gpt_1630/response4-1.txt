To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if eligible. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your **401(k)** and **IRA**, focus on a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - In **taxable accounts**, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free. Plan your withdrawals strategically.
   - Keep investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses, which should be kept in a separate savings account.

Always evaluate your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
