Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If available, contribute up to the limit, particularly if you have high income, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax breaks.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before going heavy into investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might access before retirement, as they offer liquidity without penalties, though youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance, diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you'd withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and Traditional IRA, and finally from Roth accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
