Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Tax Considerations:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for lowering taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Optimal for investing with more liquidity. Pay capital gains taxes on profits but have more flexibility.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

### 4. Age and Time Horizon:
   - Younger individuals might lean more heavily toward aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRAs, while older individuals may prefer safer investments as retirement nears.

### 5. Regular Review:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution:
- **Total Income**: 100%
  - **401(k)**: 40%
  - **IRA**: 30%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

Adjust these percentages based on your specific circumstances, goals, and preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
