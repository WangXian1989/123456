As a financial strategy, distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get full employer matching. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Maximize contributions based on eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all account types to balance risk and return.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as you age, especially as you near retirement.

A tailored approach based on your specific financial situation and goals is highly recommended. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide more personalized guidance.
