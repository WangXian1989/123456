Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you’re eligible, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. They don’t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative options in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust with Life Changes**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
