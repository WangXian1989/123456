Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum if your employer offers a high match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Money in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs is tax-deferred; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your expected future tax bracket, you might prioritize contributions to Roth accounts.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - If your goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. For shorter-term goals, like buying a home or funding education, consider the flexibility of taxable accounts, which allow for easier access to funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses. 

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their growth potential.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial advisor can further tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that maximizes tax benefits while considering your financial goals is key.
