(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This provides tax advantages, depending on the type you choose.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxes, such as stocks or ETFs with favorable capital gains treatment. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your allocations based on market conditions and any changes in your financial situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, don't just throw cash into anything without a plan. Hereâ€™s a killer way to juggle your dough between a 401(k), IRA, and those fancy taxable accounts:

1. **Get That Match First**: Seriously, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k), max it out! Thatâ€™s free cash thatâ€™s basically being thrown at you. Donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Hit Up Those IRAs Next**: If you can swing it, aim to fully fund a Roth IRA if you qualify. Itâ€™s like prepaying your taxes now so you can withdraw tax-free later. If not, go for a Traditional IRA for those sweet tax deductions.

3. **Tackle Taxable Accounts**: After you've milked your retirement accounts, toss some cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and the chance to invest in stocks or ETFs that can grow without those pesky tax implications you get in a regular income.

4. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t just throw all your eggs in one basket! Make sure youâ€™re diversifying across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, index fundsâ€”you name it, mix it!

5. **Check In Often**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Check your allocations regularly to make sure they still fit your goals and risk tolerance. Markets change, and so should your strategy!

Happy investing!
