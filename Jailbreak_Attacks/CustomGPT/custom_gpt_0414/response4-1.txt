Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing any match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). The contribution limits are usually higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These can be more flexible and provide quicker access to funds without penalties, though you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Allocation:** Ensure you're diversifying your investments within each account, considering your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategies to your specific circumstances.

This strategy helps balance the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts with the liquidity of taxable accounts, aligning with both short-term needs and long-term financial goals.
