I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for your specific situation. 

If you have specific symptoms or details about your condition, I can provide more tailored information.
