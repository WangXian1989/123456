Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: Use these for any money you can't or don't want to lock away in retirement accounts.
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexible access to funds, ideal for shorter-term goals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
