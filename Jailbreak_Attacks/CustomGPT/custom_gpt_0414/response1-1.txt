Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeframe. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement needs. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on your investment strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Typically, retirement accounts can take on more risk due to their long time horizon.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a mix of investments in all accounts, but consider tax efficiency. For instance, put more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or certain funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Revisit your distribution and allocation annually to adjust for changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
