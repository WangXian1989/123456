Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is effectively free money. If possible, consider maxing out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k), depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes on capital gains and dividends apply here, so consider holding investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of funds (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **IRA**: You may have a broader investment choice. Diversify similarly to your 401(k) but consider your overall asset allocation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments and consider what you're comfortable managing.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Older investors may want to decrease risk as they approach retirement, while younger investors can take more risks for higher potential returns.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
