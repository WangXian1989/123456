Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k):** Contributions reduce taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred. Contribute enough to get any employer match.
- **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize tax consequences.

### 2. Liquidity Needs
- **Taxable Accounts:** Provide easy access to funds without penalties. Useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
- **401(k) and IRA:** Typically have penalties for early withdrawal. Best for long-term retirement savings.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to maximize employer match in your 401(k) and contribute to IRAs (considering limits).
- **Diversify Assets:** Hold equities in tax-advantaged accounts and consider bonds in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

Adjust based on your age, risk tolerance, and how close you are to retirement. Regularly reassess to align with changing goals.
