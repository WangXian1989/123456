To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs (e.g., saving for a home), while retirement accounts can focus on long-term growth.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically check your allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these guidelines, you can strategically manage your investments in a way that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
