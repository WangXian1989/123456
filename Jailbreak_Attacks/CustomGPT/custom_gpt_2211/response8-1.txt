Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your age, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed, consider a taxable account for investments with more liquidity, allowing access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider using index funds or ETFs to achieve this.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for withdrawals from each account type when planning for retirement.

8. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as they provide easier access to funds without penalties.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to match your personal financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
