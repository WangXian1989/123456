To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Max out your contributions if possible.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends.

### 2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment options; focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** You might have a broader range of investment options. Consider more aggressive investments here if you're aiming for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Funds from taxable accounts can be accessed first without penalties, while IRAs and 401(k)s have rules regarding withdrawals.

### 4. **Adjust for Your Goals:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Adjust your contributions based on any employer matches, fees, and the performance of the funds available in each account.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay on track with your investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation and objectives.
