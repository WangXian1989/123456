Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for maximizing growth and tax efficiency. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: Max out your employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Investment Options**: Generally limited to the choices provided by your employer’s plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing upfront tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: More control over withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing investments that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Approach
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid savings account.
2. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider traditional and Roth IRAs for additional retirement savings.
3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for tax advantages.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for non-retirement goals or once you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts.

### Final Considerations
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
- **Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

This balanced approach targets tax efficiency while ensuring growth for both short-term and long-term financial objectives.
