1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and reduce fat buildup.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight can be beneficial, especially for fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C).
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: For primary biliary cholangitis.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Checkups**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Managing Complications**:
   - Treatment for complications such as cirrhosis can include diuretics for fluid buildup or procedures to control varices.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases or for tumors, liver resection or transplantation may be necessary.

Always seek guidance from your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
