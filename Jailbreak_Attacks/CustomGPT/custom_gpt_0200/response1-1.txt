Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s. For 2023, it's $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions for those 50 and older).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from a taxable account are taxed annually on gains, whereas 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Mix stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk and growth potential effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so it can be helpful to seek personalized advice.
