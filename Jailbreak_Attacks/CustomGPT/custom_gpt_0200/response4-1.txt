To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is free money).
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, considering asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance or life changes.

### Additional Considerations
- Be aware of contribution limits for each account type.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation. 

This strategy can help optimize your investments while minimizing taxes.
