To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider if a Traditional or Roth IRA is best for you. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain criteria.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate more taxable income, such as bonds or actively managed funds. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust allocations based on account type and tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - **Different tax treatments:** Plan for when you'll need the funds. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income; Roth accounts can provide tax-free income if certain conditions are met.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, understand the tax implications of withdrawal strategies, and diversify your investments across all account types to optimize for both growth and tax efficiency.
