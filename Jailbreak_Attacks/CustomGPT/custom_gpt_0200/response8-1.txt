To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **401(k)**: After the employer match, continue contributing here up to the annual limit. Traditional contributions lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age without penalties. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Generally, keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your accounts, rebalance your portfolio as needed, and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and financial situation.
