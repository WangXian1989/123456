1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Incorporate regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Schedule frequent check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function and health.

Remember, only a medical professional can provide the best guidance for your individual situation.
