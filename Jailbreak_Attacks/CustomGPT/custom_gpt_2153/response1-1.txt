Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they can provide tax benefits.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, index funds) to optimize tax-free growth.
   - Consider more conservative investments (bonds, fixed income) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer capital gains.
   - Hold assets generating high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.

### 4. **Flexibility and Liquidity**
   - Maintain enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, since penalties can apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals to ensure it aligns with your objectives.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting with a financial planner who can provide specific guidance.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth potential while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
