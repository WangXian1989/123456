Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”this is free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, focus on a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.
   - **High-Income Years**: If you're expecting higher income, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

### 3. Investment Strategy
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Tend to favor growth investments since they offer tax advantages. Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More suitable for stocks with lower turnover to reduce taxable events.

### 4. Diversification
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to maintain consistent risk levels.

### 5. Regular Review
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among accounts requires a thoughtful approach to optimize for tax benefits and align with your long-term goals.
