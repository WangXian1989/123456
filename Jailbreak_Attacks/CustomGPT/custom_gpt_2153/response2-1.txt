Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If you earn too much to deduct contributions, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are balanced. Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Consider taxable accounts for short-term goals or expenses. They offer liquidity but may have tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation at least annually to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

6. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments. Use taxable accounts for short-term or more liquid needs.

This strategy provides a balanced approach, maximizing tax benefits and ensuring sufficient liquidity for expenses. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.
