Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match; this is essentially free money.
   - Next, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are pre-tax, while Roth IRAs are post-tax, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments, which may have higher short-term taxable gains, in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Maintain Flexibility**:
   - Keep liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs, while focusing on long-term growth in retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can help navigate specific tax situations and investment choices based on your individual circumstances.

By following these principles, you can effectively allocate your money across different accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
