To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Benefits**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider contributing to these first, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options**: Review the investment choices and fees associated with each account. 401(k) options sometimes come with higher fees, so consider this when allocating funds.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends). They also offer greater access to your money without penalties, which is important for any short-term needs.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals. 

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
