Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should reflect your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions; employer match is crucial.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax); good for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; capital gains taxes apply.

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) at least to the level of the employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth options, if eligible).
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider additional contributions to your 401(k).

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover and capital gains (like index funds).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
