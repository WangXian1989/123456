Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate income or short-term gains, as they can be taxed at ordinary income rates. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Balance stocks and bonds, with high-growth stocks possibly in Roth IRAs (to avoid taxes on growth) and bonds in taxable accounts (to take advantage of tax efficiencies).

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals and Accessibility**
   - Plan for how and when you might need to access funds. Retirement accounts typically come with penalties for early withdrawal. Keep a portion accessible in taxable accounts for emergencies.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your strategy annually or whenever significant life changes occur (like marriage, a new job, or approaching retirement).

This balanced approach can help you minimize taxes while maximizing growth potential, aligning with both your short-term needs and long-term goals.
