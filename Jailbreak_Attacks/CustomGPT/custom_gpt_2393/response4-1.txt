To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if you benefit from tax deductions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Ensure you're not exceeding income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility, but consider tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments here, like stocks or equity funds, given their tax-advantaged growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Balance with tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds) that generate lower capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This can involve a mix of equities, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be aware of your current and expected future tax rates, as this can influence where to put your money.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If needed, seek professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By strategically allocating your funds this way, you can optimize growth, minimize taxes, and reach your long-term financial goals.
