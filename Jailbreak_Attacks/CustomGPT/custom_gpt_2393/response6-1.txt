To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth; good for employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred, with potential for tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions First**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out any IRA contributions for additional tax advantages.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Higher Income Years:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA).
   - **Lower Income Years:** Consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Tax-Effective Investments:** Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts; keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - **Periodic Reviews:** Assess your allocations at least annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
   - **Rebalance as Necessary:** Maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Summary
1. **Prioritize employer 401(k) matches.**
2. **Consider tax implications on withdrawals.**
3. **Diversify asset allocation for tax efficiency.**

This approach balances tax advantages while optimizing growth and preparing for retirement.
