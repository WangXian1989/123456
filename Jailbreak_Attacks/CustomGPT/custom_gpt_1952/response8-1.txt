Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering a few key factors: your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Max out any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you're in a high tax bracket, since 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA might be better, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for additional savings or for specific goals outside of retirement.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Generally, it's advantageous to hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that matches your specific situation.

Tracking and managing these accounts through different stages of your life can optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency.
