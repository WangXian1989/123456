Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan; contributions are often pre-tax. Consider maximizing any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility and can be used for short-term goals, but dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions next. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for investments with high growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Shorter Term:** Consider holding bonds or cash in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes if you plan to access those funds sooner.

### 4. **Factor in Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Focus:** If youâ€™re years from retirement, focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and law changes regarding taxes.

### Sample Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
2. Max out your IRA.
3. After reaching these goals, consider additional contributions to your 401(k) and invest any extra funds in a taxable account.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach tailored to your personal financial situation and goals is essential for effective money distribution. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
