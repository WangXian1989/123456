When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### Allocation Strategies

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Use these for short-term needs or after fully funding tax-advantaged accounts.

### Percentage Breakdown
- **Aggressive Growth Strategy**: Invest 60% in your 401(k) (max contribution), 30% in an IRA, and 10% in taxable accounts.
- **Balanced Strategy**: Aim for 50% in a 401(k), 30% in IRA, and 20% in taxable accounts.
- **Conservative Approach**: Allocate 40% to a 401(k), 40% to an IRA, and 20% to taxable accounts.

### Additional Considerations
- **Investment Vehicles**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
