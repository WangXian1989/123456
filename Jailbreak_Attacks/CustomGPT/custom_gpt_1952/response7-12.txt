I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment, but here are some general treatment options that may be considered for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, abstaining from alcohol, and exercising regularly can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Supplements**: In some cases, supplements such as milk thistle or vitamin E may be recommended, but always discuss these with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging may be required to assess liver function and progression of any condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, surgical interventions or liver transplantation might be considered.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options.
