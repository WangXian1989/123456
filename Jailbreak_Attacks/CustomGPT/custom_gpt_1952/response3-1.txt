Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation). The IRA often has more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial professional who can personalize your strategy based on your specifics.

This approach combines maximizing benefits from tax-advantaged accounts while keeping flexibility with taxable accounts.
