Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Max out any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) if you want to lower your taxable income now or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Aim to max out your contributions annually.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Invest in low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-efficient strategies, like harvesting losses, to offset gains.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Individual Factors:
- Assess your overall tax situation.
- Consider your retirement timeline.
- Factor in your risk tolerance and investment preferences.
