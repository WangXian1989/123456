To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax benefits and can diversify your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts and have additional money to invest, use taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investing without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider holding bonds or high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation periodically and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize tax exposure.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.
