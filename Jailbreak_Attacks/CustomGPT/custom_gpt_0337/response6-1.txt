To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, subject to income limits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Funds**: Prioritize tax-efficient investment options in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid, conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
