I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options usually depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or diuretics for cirrhosis might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
