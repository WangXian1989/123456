To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the match, then consider your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, make contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial for younger investors.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but come with potential capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications when planning withdrawals, especially from tax-deferred accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
