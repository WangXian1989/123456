Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for pre-tax contributions or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and tax implications. Good for additional tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment selections across accounts are diversified. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation and account performance.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement timing and any anticipated withdrawals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
