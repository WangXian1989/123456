I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and managing weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In some cases, procedures or surgeries may be necessary. It's crucial to follow up with a healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific situation.
