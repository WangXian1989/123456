To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Since contributions to a 401(k) are often made pre-tax, prioritize maximizing your contributions to take advantage of employer matching (if available). Focus on investing in a diversified mix of investment options offered within the 401(k). This could include a combination of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, so consider funding this account if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future. If eligible, aim to maximize your contributions here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for money that you might need access to in the short term since taxes on gains will need to be paid in the year they are realized. Prioritize investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover rates and, consequently, reduced capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Max out contributions to your 401(k)** up to the employer match first.
- **Contribute to your IRA** (consider a Roth for tax-free growth).
- **Any remaining funds** can be allocated to your taxable accounts. 

### Review and Adjust: 
Regularly review your investment allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or changes in tax laws. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals. 

By creating a systematic approach that prioritizes tax advantages and growth potential, you can enhance your overall investment strategy.
