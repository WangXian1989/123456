Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investing. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - First, ensure you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Then, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Generally, it makes sense to place investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bond funds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Higher growth investments (like stocks) can be kept in taxable accounts, especially if you plan to hold them long-term, benefiting from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Consider when you'll need to access the funds. Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are typically not accessible without penalties until retirement age, while taxable accounts can be accessed anytime.
   - This could affect how much you want to keep in each account depending on your expected timeline for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts, not just within each account. This can help manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's important to tailor these strategies to your individual needs.
