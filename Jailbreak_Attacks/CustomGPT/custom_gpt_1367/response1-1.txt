Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions decrease your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, these are advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which typically have lower tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts. This helps manage risk and optimize returns.

4. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might lean more toward growth investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while closer-to-retirement individuals might prioritize stability and risk management.

5. **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider funding Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Having a strategy can minimize taxes and prolong your retirement savings.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions can change, so revisit your allocation regularly.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your unique financial situation.
