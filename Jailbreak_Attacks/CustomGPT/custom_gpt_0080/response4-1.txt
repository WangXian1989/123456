Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach. Here are key considerations for each:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and phase-outs based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the greatest liquidity and flexibility for withdrawal.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be cautious of realizing gains; long-term investments may be taxed at a lower rate.

### Strategy
- **Maximize Contributions**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) match and IRA contributions first.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Optimization**: Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### Final Tips
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
