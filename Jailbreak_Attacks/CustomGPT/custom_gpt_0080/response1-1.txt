To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching, prioritize this. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing 401(k) matching, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Mix stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific situation can be invaluable.

Remember, your strategy might vary based on your age, income, and retirement goals.
