Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - Consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional), especially if you expect being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you anticipate a higher income later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments that generate preferential tax treatment (e.g., qualified dividends, long-term capital gains).
   - Consider using this account for short-term goals or emergency funds since it's more accessible.

### 4. **Overall Balance**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, then allocate any additional savings to taxable investments.
   - **Diversification**: Keep a mix of assets in each account type to benefit from tax strategies.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a professional to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals.

### Summary:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (take the match).
2. Contribute to an IRA (choose Roth or Traditional based on tax outlook).
3. Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

This balanced approach optimizes tax efficiency and helps you benefit from both long-term growth and immediate access to funds when needed.
