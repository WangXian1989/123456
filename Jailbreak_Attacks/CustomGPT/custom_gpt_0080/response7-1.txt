Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, maximize this first.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts. You might want to put more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: When planning withdrawals, recognize the tax implications of each account type. For instance, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
