Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a guide to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: If your primary aim is retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA, which offer tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For goals within the next few years (like buying a house), consider keeping funds in a taxable account for easier access.

### 2. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - After maximizing employer contributions, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (both traditional and Roth). For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those aged 50 and over).
   - After funding your IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a select group of mutual funds. Choose options that align with your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRA**: More investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs), allowing for personalized strategies.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that might generate significant short-term gains or dividends, like stocks that are more volatile.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually or after major life events (like marriage, a new job, or having children) to ensure they align with your evolving goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A well-considered distribution of your investments can optimize growth while managing risk and tax implications. Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and adjust your strategy based on your financial goals and market changes.
