To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Account Types
- **401(k)**: A retirement account provided by an employer, typically with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends. They offer more liquidity but fewer tax advantages.

### 2. Maximize Employer Contributions
If you have access to a 401(k) with employer matching, prioritize contributing enough to receive the maximum match. This is essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-deferred Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that may generate significant taxable income, such as bonds or REITs.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. Diversify Your Investments
Aim for a diversified portfolio across all your accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when selecting an asset allocation. Common strategies include:
- **Stocks** for long-term growth
- **Bonds** for stability and income
- **Real Estate Investments** for diversification

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
As your investments grow and change, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This might mean shifting funds between your accounts based on performance and your financial goals.

### 6. Evaluate Your Retirement Needs
Consider your target retirement age and income needs when planning distributions. If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift more funds into safer, income-generating investments.

### 7. Use Tax Strategies
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, you can sell losing investments to offset gains and reduce your tax liability.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, plan how you’ll withdraw funds from each account. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your current financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances. Remember to regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed to stay on track with your financial goals.
