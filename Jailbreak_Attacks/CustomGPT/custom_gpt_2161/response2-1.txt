Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. **Contribute to Your Employer's 401(k)**
- **Maximize Matching Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.
  
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  
- **IRA Contributions**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), your tax strategy may vary. 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket; you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later.

### 3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**
- **Annual Contribution Limits**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA once you can afford to do so. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely**
- Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for additional investment opportunities.
- **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds or ETFs that generate lower capital gains distributions, and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid interest income being taxed at ordinary rates.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
- **Asset Allocation**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Adjust Contributions**: As your income changes or you reach retirement age, reassess where to direct new contributions to optimize your tax situation and growth potential.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- While general guidelines are valuable, personalized advice can enhance your financial strategy. A certified financial planner can provide tailored recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing retirement accounts, efficiently managing your tax situation, and investing wisely in taxable accounts, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your approach will help maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities as you prepare for retirement.
