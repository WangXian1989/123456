Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach you can follow:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, these accounts often have employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Be aware of the contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages. You pay capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.
   - **Additional 401(k) contributions**: After maximizing the match and the IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments outside of retirement after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - Younger investors can afford to take more risks with higher allocations in stocks. Older investors approaching retirement may want to gradually shift to more conservative investments.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with higher potential tax liabilities (like bonds or actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investments and asset allocation at least annually to adjust for any changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (enough to max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for 50 and older)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds after maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions

### Conclusion:
By understanding the specific benefits and limitations of each account, you can strategically allocate your funds to optimize your savings and investment growth. Regularly review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals. If needed, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
