Investing strategy can vary depending on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, but here’s a general approach to consider when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). A Roth IRA is particularly appealing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** If funds remain, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit, as this allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These can be useful for shorter-term goals or access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that regardless of account type, you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Monitor your investment allocations regularly and adjust as needed based on life changes, market performance, and investment goals.

This framework should give you a solid approach for distributing your investments across different account types efficiently. It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
