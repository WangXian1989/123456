The ideal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a **Roth IRA**, where contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a **Traditional IRA** might be more beneficial, as you get a tax deduction now and pay taxes upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts, particularly if you need liquidity or have short-term goals. It's also beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments in each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance:
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, because they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) in your taxable account to optimize tax impacts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio distribution and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
