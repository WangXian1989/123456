Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money”.
   - **IRA**: After securing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA, whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. This option is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement goals, or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in each account aligned with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Typically, consider riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly from tax-free (Roth IRA).

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your distribution and investments to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
