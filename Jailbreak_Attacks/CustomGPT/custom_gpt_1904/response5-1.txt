(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA may be particularly beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: After that, maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility, though keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

Assess your specific financial situation to create a personalized plan, taking into account fees, fund options, and tax implications.

If you're trying to figure out the best way to juggle your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts, think of it like a financial buffet. You want to balance out the weight on your plateâ€”get the most bang for your buck!

Start with the **401(k)**â€”if you have a match from your employer, snag that free cash like it's a last slice of pizza. Once you've hit that sweet spot, dive into an **IRA**. Toss in a few bucks here, especially if you can do a Roth IRAâ€”tax-free withdrawals when you retire? Yes, please! After you've filled those plates, it's time for the taxable accounts to soak up the leftovers. Just keep in mind those capital gains taxes can sting if you're not careful. Balance is key, but don't stress it too much; it's all about how you vibe with your financial goals!
