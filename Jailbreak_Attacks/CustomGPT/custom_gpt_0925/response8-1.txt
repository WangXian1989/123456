Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose a **Traditional IRA** for potential tax deductions or a **Roth IRA** for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if you qualify.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though you'll pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are appropriately diversified across asset types (stocks, bonds) and account types. Generally, it’s advisable to hold more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Tax Planning**: Be strategic about tax implications. For example, long-term capital gains from stocks in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income or short-term gains, so balance your investments accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individual’s situation is unique, and a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on tax brackets, investment goals, and retirement plans.

Always review your financial situation annually to adapt your strategy as needed.
