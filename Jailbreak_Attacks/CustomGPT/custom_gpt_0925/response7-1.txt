Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **Investment Options**: Review the funds available in your 401(k) and choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth; choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and ensure you're maximizing them if it makes sense for you.
- **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without the penalties associated with retirement accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or projects, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

### **General Strategy**
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Fund accounts based on when you need access. Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term savings.
- **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

### **Example Distribution Approach**
- **Contribute Enough to 401(k) for Match**: e.g., 5-10% of salary until the match is maxed.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: e.g., $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) annually.
- **Any Remaining Funds**: Invest in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This balanced approach helps to take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity for future needs. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
