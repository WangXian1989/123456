When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Another retirement savings vehicle, also tax-advantaged. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax advantages. You pay capital gains tax on profits and taxes on dividends or interest.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax efficiency**: Place the most tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income.
   - **Long-term growth**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as stocks held for long periods to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Higher-income earners may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts to lower current taxable income.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be preferable since taxes are paid upfront and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your overall investment goals and timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation annually or after major life events (like a job change, marriage, or having children) to ensure it aligns with your goals.

By following these steps, you can create an effective strategy that maximizes your retirement savings and manages your tax liabilities efficiently.
