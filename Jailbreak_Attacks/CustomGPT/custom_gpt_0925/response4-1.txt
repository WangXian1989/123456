To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, but limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals and a wider range of investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially if you can't contribute more to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Use these for long-term investments such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you might keep more liquid assets or investments that generate capital gains or dividends (remember, capital gains are taxed annually).

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand how taxes will apply upon withdrawals. Traditional accounts may incur taxes during withdrawal; Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals after conditions are met.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Approach
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds based on your liquidity needs and risk appetite.

By thoughtfully considering the benefits and implications of each account type, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
