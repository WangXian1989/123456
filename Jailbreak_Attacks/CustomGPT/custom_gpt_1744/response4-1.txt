Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** These accounts grow tax-free until withdrawal. Aim to maximize contributions here, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. They’re also useful for long-term capital gains, which are generally taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, 401(k) limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50+), while IRA limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+).

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan how you’ll withdraw funds. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This helps manage risk and align with your overall investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation.

### 7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

Consider your personal circumstances and goals when deciding how to allocate funds.
