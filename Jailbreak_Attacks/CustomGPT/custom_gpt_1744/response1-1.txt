Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as they provide either tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Keep long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit most from growth without immediate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might sell in the short term, as they are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Keep higher-risk investments in accounts with more tax advantages.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can have tax consequences. Consider your projected tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
