To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If you can, aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate higher tax burdens (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) and hold lower-taxed assets (like growth stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds: typically, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
