Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Pre-tax Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**:
     - Lower taxable income in the present. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.
   - **After-tax Accounts (Roth IRA)**:
     - Contributions grow tax-free; withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. Ideal if you expect higher income in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to grow your investments more efficiently.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Different account types can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds) to balance risk and growth potential.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **First**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Second**: Max out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits.
- **Third**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or if you exceed the contribution limits of retirement accounts.

### Regular Review
- Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws. 

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your overall financial picture.
