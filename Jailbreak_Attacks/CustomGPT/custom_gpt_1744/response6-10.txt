Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect can make them more comfortable and willing to share information. This can involve:
   - Active listening and showing empathy.
   - Using non-confrontational questioning techniques.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Employing effective interviewing strategies helps gather information without coercion. Some approaches include:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging the suspect to recall events in detail.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing the suspect to elaborate freely rather than providing yes or no answers.

3. **Use of Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights under the Fifth Amendment, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel, establishes a clear framework for information gathering.

4. **Non-Verbal Cues**: Observing body language and emotional responses during interviews can provide insights without directly violating rights.

5. **Legal Techniques**: Utilizing lawful methods such as:
   - Subpoenas for records or phone data.
   - Search warrants, conducted within legal bounds.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
