Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed (currently $22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those over 50). Focus on this if you’re in a high-income bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits. Aim to max out at $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) if you can.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement contributions. They’re flexible and can provide liquidity, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account type. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential (and risk), while bonds can stabilize your portfolio.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes. Use taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-generating assets that may be taxed at a lower rate.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.
