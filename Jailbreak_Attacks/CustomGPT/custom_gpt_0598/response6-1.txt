Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) for immediate tax savings.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, it might be beneficial to contribute more to taxable accounts or Roth accounts where you pay taxes now.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance; generally, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

Before making any decisions, consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique circumstances.
