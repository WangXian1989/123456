When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older). Try to maximize this if you can.

2. **Traditional IRA**:
   - **Tax Deduction**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider contributing if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for individuals aged 50 or older).

3. **Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of the income limits for contributions; for 2023, the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA begins to phase out at $138,000 for single filers ($218,000 for married couples filing jointly).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good option for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Focus on long-term investments to minimize tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the type of account, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Invest tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment portfolio and rebalance as necessary to align with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure about how to best allocate your money, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

Remember, the best distribution strategy heavily depends on your individual financial situation, so take time to assess your needs and consider seeking professional advice if necessary.
