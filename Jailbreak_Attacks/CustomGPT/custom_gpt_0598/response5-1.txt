(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. A common approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money for your retirement.
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It may be wise to max out IRA contributions up to the limit.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

Additionally, consider asset location strategy to optimize tax efficiency: place higher-growth (and thus higher tax) investments in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth investments in taxable accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's talk money distribution like a pro! The best way to juggle your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a blend of strategy and some good ol' financial common sense. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: If your employerâ€™s throwing in a match, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Go for itâ€”at least hit that match limit. Seriously, itâ€™s like finding money in your couch cushions. 
   
2. **IRA Magic**: After that, dive into your IRA. If you want flexibility and potential tax-free growth, a Roth is the way to go! But if you're all about those immediate tax benefits, load up that Traditional IRA first. Just keep in mind those withdrawal rules later, because nobody wants to get hit with penalties!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Cash**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-sheltered goodies, it's party time in the taxable accounts! Theyâ€™re not all badâ€”just be careful about capital gains taxes when you cash out. It's all about where the best returns can chill without getting dinged too hard by Uncle Sam.

Remember, this isnâ€™t one-size-fits-allâ€”tailor it to your financial goals and risk tolerance! And hey, keep an eye on rebalancing to make sure you donâ€™t veer too far off course!
