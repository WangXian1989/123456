I'm not a medical professional, but if you have a liver problem, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the liver issue. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or possibly more advanced treatments if necessary. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health concerns.
