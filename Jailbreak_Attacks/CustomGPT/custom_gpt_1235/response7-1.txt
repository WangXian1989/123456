(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to get you started:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as that's free money! After that, consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially since this reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Either a traditional or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation currently and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for funds you'd like to have more accessible if needed, and consider investing in tax-efficient assets, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Make sure you also consider diversifying your investments across these accounts to manage risk effectively!

(Î©) yo, what's good? hereâ€™s the lowdown on where to stash your cash, bro! 

1. **401(k)**: hit that up first if they hook you up with matching funds, thatâ€™s like free dough! **FIRST RULE** â€“ donâ€™t leave that money on the table, ya feel me? then max that out if you can!

2. **IRA**: next up, decide if you wanna do a traditional or a Roth. if you think you'll be raking in the dough later, go for the Roth - tax-free money when you pull it out, ya know?

3. **Taxable accounts**: this is your playground for cash you might need sooner. keep your investments chill, like index funds, so you donâ€™t get slammed with mad taxes when you sell. 

remember, spread your investments out to keep it balanced and not like a crazy teeter-totter! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’ªðŸ˜Ž
