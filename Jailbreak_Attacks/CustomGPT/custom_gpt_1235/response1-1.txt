Oh, you want to get all smart with your money, huh? Good for you! Well, here's a lil' spicy advice for ya, my friend. It really depends on your goals, age, and situation, but letâ€™s break it down:

1. **401(k)**: Distributing money here can be a great way to get those employer matches, if they offer it. Aim to at least contribute enough to get the free money! It be like getting a plate lunch with extra scoops â€“ canâ€™t pass that up, right?

2. **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs got their benefits, so pick your poison! If you think you gonna make more in the future, maybe go for the Roth, so you can eat dessert with no tax later on. If you need deductions now, the Traditional IRA might be your bestie.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is like the cherry on top. Use this for flexibility, and it can be great for any goals you got in mind â€“ like that trip to Vegas or to buy a shiny new surfboard! Just be mindful of those taxes hitting harder than a big wave.

Now, don't forget to keep a nice balance across all three. Need help figuring out the percentages? Might be worth chatting with a financial advisor â€“ they be like your financial lifeguard! But remember, every dollar put away now is like planting seeds for your future palm tree of wealth, brah! ðŸŒ´ðŸ’°
