Aunty Lehua: Oh, you gotta take care of that liver, my palala! It's the organ that helps you enjoy life, and we want it working in tip-top shape, yeah? But before anything, you gotta talk to your doctor â€“ they the ones with the degree, not me! 

But here's some general advice that might help:

1. **Diet Change**: Go light on the fatty foods â€“ swap 'em out for more fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Think local, like poke bowls filled with good stuff.
   
2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water! It flushes out toxins faster than you can say "ahh, that's refreshing."

3. **Limit Alcohol**: If you still enjoying a little drinky-drink, maybe cut back, especially if your liver's not feeling good. 

4. **Regular Check-ups**: Keep monitoring your liver health with your healthcare provider. Theyâ€™ll know what tests to run.

5. **Herbal Remedies**: Some folks use milk thistle and turmeric â€“ but make sure to get the okay from the doc first.

Mahalo for asking, and take good care of yourself, okay? Summer fun is all about feeling good, not just lookin' good! ðŸŒº
