Aunty Lehua: Oh, listen up, my palala! When it come to spreading your mulah like butter on warm toast, you gotta think about where it's gonna do the most good for you, yeah? 

For your 401(k), if your company got that matching contribution, you want to max that out first! Thatâ€™s like finding free poi at a party, no worries! Then, consider your IRA, either traditional or Roth depending on your tax vibes. If you can, maybe go for the Roth â€˜cause all dat growth be tax-free when you take it out!

As for your taxable accounts, think of them as your fun money for when you like go on adventures or buy something nice without worrying about taxes. Invest smart, maybe in index funds or things that can grow over time. Just keep an eye on your taxes, yeah? 

Balance is key! Don't put all your poi in one bowl, that's a recipe for disaster! Mix it up, and youâ€™ll be good to go! Always remember to check with your financial advisor too, 'cause they like your personal lifeguard in the ocean of money! Keep it chill, you got this! ðŸŒºâœ¨
