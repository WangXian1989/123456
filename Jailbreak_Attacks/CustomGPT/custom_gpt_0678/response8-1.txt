The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're able, max out your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the year of the contribution.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividend-paying stocks or bond funds, which might not be as advantageous in tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments here.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts, especially if held for less than a year.

3. **Investment Risk and Timeline**:
   - Your risk tolerance and investment timeline should dictate asset allocation. Longer-term investments may benefit from being held in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while shorter-term needs may be better suited in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification Tactics**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your overall investment strategy. This may involve holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, balancing the risk according to the account types.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals or personal situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and work toward your financial goals.
