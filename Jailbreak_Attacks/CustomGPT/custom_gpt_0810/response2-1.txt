Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the max contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment strategies that generate lower taxes, like holding investments for over a year to benefit from capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure you’re on track to meet your goals and adjust as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep some cash or easily accessible investments outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances, such as your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
