   - **Weight Management**: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol as they can impact liver health.
