Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Focus on this if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Offers both traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) options. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you might need before retirement. Prioritize investments with lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid or stable investments (bonds, cash equivalents).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust for market changes and your risk tolerance.

5. **Account for Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement, keep some funds in taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
