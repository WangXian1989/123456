Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - If you're eligible and your income allows, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions for tax-deferred growth, reducing your taxable income now.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility. These accounts can provide easier access to funds without penalties and more diverse investment options.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Think about how to allocate different types of investments (stocks, bonds) across these accounts based on tax implications. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits for each account type to make the most of tax-advantaged savings.

7. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current and projected future tax brackets when deciding where to place your money.

8. **Ongoing Reassessment**:
   - Regularly revisit your strategy as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
