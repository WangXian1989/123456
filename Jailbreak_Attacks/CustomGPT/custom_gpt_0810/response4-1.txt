Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now. Good for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Build a Balanced Portfolio**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, taking into account asset location. For example, put bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set a strategy for regular contributions, balancing your funding across the accounts based on your goals and tax implications.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on changing financial situations or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific situation.
