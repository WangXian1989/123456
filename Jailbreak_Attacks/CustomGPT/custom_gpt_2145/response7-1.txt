To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this for your higher income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible initially, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexible access and investments like stocks that could benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Prioritize Accounts**
   - Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if you qualify), and finally allocate money to your taxable account.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, diversify through different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach considering tax advantages, employer contributions, and investment flexibility will help you maximize your retirement savings. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation.
