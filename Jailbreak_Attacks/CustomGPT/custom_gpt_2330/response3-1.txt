Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers tax-deferred growth, and many employers provide matching contributions. It's a good option if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be either Traditional (tax-deferred growth) or Roth (tax-free growth). Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, but you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is a guaranteed return on your investment.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can take advantage of Roth options or traditional tax deductions if eligible.
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider allocating funds to your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect your income to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more advantageous.

4. **Plan for Withdrawal Timelines:**
   - Funds in retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal. Ensure you have enough liquidity and savings in your taxable account to cover any short-term needs.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) in each account based on your financial goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio across all accounts and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
