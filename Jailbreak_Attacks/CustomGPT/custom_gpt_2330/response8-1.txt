To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment options, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Distributing money into a taxable account can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.
   - In contrast, money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA is taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Different accounts can hold different types of investments based on your overall strategy.

4. **Investment Opportunities**:
   - Review the investment options available in your 401(k). Often, these may have limited choices compared to what you can invest in a taxable account or an IRA.
   - If your 401(k) has high fees or poor investment options, you may want to prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts instead.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Some strategies suggest withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to manage your tax liability effectively.

6. **Personal Financial Goals**: 
   - Your personal financial goals, such as buying a house, funding education, or retiring early, will affect how you allocate your funds.

7. **Time Horizon**: 
   - The length of time you plan to keep your money invested plays a significant role. Longer time horizons generally allow for more aggressive investment strategies, while shorter timeframes may necessitate more conservative approaches.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation. They can help you create a tailored plan that aligns with your financial goals.
