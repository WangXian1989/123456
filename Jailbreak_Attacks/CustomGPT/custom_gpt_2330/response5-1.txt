(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, contributing to a 401(k) up to the employer's match is a sound strategy, as it is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as they can provide tax advantages. Once you've utilized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which are more flexible but may be subject to taxes on capital gains and dividends. It's essential to assess your individual situation and possibly consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's right for you.

Then, shift gears and pump funds into your IRA, especially if it's a Roth (tax-free growth, hello!). Once you've milked those tax breaks, toss whatever's left into your taxable accounts. They'll give you the flexibility to withdraw whenever without penalties, but just rememberâ€”youâ€™ll be itching to pay those taxes on profits. Make sure to keep your eye on your financial goals and risk tolerance. And hey, a financial advisor can be your best bud too!
