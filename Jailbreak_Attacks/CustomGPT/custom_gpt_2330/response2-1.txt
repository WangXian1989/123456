The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions from your employer, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and your money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including earnings. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Use each type of account to hold different kinds of investments. For example, you might hold more volatile investments in your Roth IRA (since you won’t pay taxes on gains) and more stable, income-producing investments in your taxable accounts (where you’ll pay taxes on dividends and interest).

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, you might lean more heavily on growth-oriented investments in all accounts, while closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative options.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Always ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid and accessible account before committing significant funds to retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review your allocations at least annually and adjust as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation and help you create a tailored strategy.
