To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out Your IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA, for instance, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you need liquidity or plan on accessing the funds in the near term, prioritize taxable accounts. 
   - **Long-Term Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: The 401(k) and IRA are better suited for long-term growth due to their tax benefits on capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that you have a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund in cash or liquid assets to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your allocations periodically to ensure you remain aligned with your investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By smartly distributing your investments between these accounts, you can optimize your savings and grow your wealth efficiently over time.
