Distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs can provide tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. As of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last:** Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but do not provide tax benefits.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider using a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance and Review Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions as needed based on your financial situation and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary from person to person, so it's crucial to assess your individual financial goals and situation.
