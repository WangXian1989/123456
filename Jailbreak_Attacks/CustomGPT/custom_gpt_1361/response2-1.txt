Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions up to the IRS limit (e.g., $22,500 for those under 50 in 2023). This can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments where you might need liquidity. This is also where you can hold investments like stocks that benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across accounts to suit your risk tolerance. Growth investments may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can go in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions and investment choices based on changing goals or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This approach will help you build a balanced portfolio that maximizes your potential for growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
