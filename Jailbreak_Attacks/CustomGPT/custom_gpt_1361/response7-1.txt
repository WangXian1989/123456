Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially “free money.” Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction upfront.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These could be for shorter-term goals or higher-risk investments since they are not subject to the same withdrawal restrictions.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy. This could involve shifting funds between accounts based on annual contributions and performance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor or tax professional.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and following a thoughtful investment strategy, you can optimize your overall returns and effectively manage your investments for retirement.
