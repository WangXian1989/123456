Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (e.g., buying a house within five years).
   - **Long-term Goals:** Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the maximum limit. Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If possible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Invest Wisely in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider Municipal Bonds or low-turnover index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Tax Bracket**
   - If in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. In lower brackets, consider Roth conversions or maximizing Roth IRA contributions.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation and financial goals at least annually or when there are significant life changes (e.g., marriage, new job, retirement).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

By carefully balancing contributions, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes over your investment horizon.
