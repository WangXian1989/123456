To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contribution**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Prioritize this after maxing out your employer match.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Once youâ€™ve maxed your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit. Consider a Roth 401(k) if available and suitable for your tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This gives flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse mix of investments across all accounts to mitigate risk, including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax impact of withdrawals from different accounts. For example, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

By following this approach, you'll create a balanced strategy that leverages tax advantages and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
