Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available (often 3-6%).
   - **Growth-focused investments**: Consider a mix of stocks or mutual funds, especially if you're younger.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax advantages**: If eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **Contribute up to the limit**: Aim for the maximum ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow easy access to funds without penalties.
   - **Invest for long-term growth**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- After that, focus on maxing out an IRA.
- Finally, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation according to your comfort level with risk.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you have a balanced portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consult a professional**: Consider a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

### Summary:
1. Max out 401(k) to employer match.
2. Max out IRA contributions.
3. Invest extra funds in taxable accounts.
