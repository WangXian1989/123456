To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA and Roth IRA, if eligible. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains and dividend taxes in your taxable account. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting or holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates can be useful.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type to manage risk effectively.

Tailor this strategy to your individual financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
