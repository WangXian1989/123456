Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still save more, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for accessing funds before retirement and allow for potentially favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep tax implications in mind. Taxable accounts are best for assets that produce lower capital gains or qualified dividends. High-turnover investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying investments across all accounts—stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

**Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
