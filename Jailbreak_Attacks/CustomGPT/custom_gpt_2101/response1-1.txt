To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deductible contributions.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account; tax-deductible or Roth options, offering tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed annually; no contribution limits, more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **First:** Contribute to the 401(k) up to the match.
   - **Second:** Fund an IRA (preferably Roth if you qualify, for tax-free growth).
   - **Third:** Max out your 401(k) contributions (if finances allow).
   - **Fourth:** Utilize a taxable account for any additional savings or investments.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may not be the best choice; traditional accounts might be ideal.

### 5. **Liquid vs. Long-Term Needs:**
   - Keep short-term needs in taxable accounts for easier access, while long-term savings go into tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and achieve your investment goals effectively.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocations in each account based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market performance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts requires careful planning, especially concerning tax implications and your financial goals. Start by maximizing your employer's match and then strategically allocate funds into IRAs and taxable accounts.
