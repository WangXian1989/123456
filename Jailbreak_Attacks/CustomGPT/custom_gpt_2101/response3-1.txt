Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need in the next 1-5 years.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments not subject to retirement account rules; allows for more flexibility but can be taxed on capital gains and dividends.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) if you anticipate a higher income later or want tax-free withdrawals.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Automate Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for performance discrepancies.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match. Aim for 15-20% of your salary if possible.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if you can (e.g., $6,500 for traditional or Roth IRAs as of 2023).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use remaining discretionary income for investments, focusing on tax-efficient options.

### Conclusion
The right strategy varies by individual. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your unique situation.
