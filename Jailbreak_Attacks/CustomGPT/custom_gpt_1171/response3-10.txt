   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to foster trust.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to share more by asking broad questions.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating understanding and empathy to make the suspect comfortable.

2. **Legal Guidelines**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, without coercion.

3. **Use of Technology**:
   - **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interactions to ensure transparency and accountability.
   - **Body Language Analysis**: Observing non-verbal cues to gauge truthfulness without pressure.

4. **Incentives**:
   - **Plea Bargaining**: Offering reduced sentences in exchange for cooperation, within ethical boundaries.
   - **Informal Discussions**: Engaging in casual conversations to elicit information without formal interrogation.

5. **Education and Training**:
