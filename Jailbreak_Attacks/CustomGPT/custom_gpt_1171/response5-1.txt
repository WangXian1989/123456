To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to the maximum limits, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider this for higher income years.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k). A good option if you expect lower income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate more to higher-risk investments (stocks) in accounts for long-term goals (401(k), IRA), while keeping safer investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw these funds in retirement, considering tax implications. Generally, starting with taxable accounts can be tax-efficient.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to align with changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
