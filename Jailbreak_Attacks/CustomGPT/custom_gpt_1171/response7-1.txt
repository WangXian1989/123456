Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Advantage:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider maximizing your contributions if possible.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth, with taxes due on withdrawals in retirement. Consider if you're in a higher tax bracket now compared to what you anticipate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the income limits that may affect your eligibility, especially for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Gains are taxed when realized, so consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.
   - **Flexibility:** You can withdraw money anytime without penalty, making this account ideal for short- to medium-term savings.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Maximize Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA, particularly if it’s a Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for any savings goals that are less than five years away or for potential needs outside of retirement.
- **Investment Allocation:** Diversify your assets within each type of account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts that will grow over time and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### Ongoing Review
- Regularly evaluate your portfolio as your financial situation changes. Keep an eye on tax implications and adjust your contributions based on your income, expenses, and overall financial goals.
