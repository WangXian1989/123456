Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) up to the limit ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if age 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable investment accounts for additional savings. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, though investment gains are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxable. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals, making them beneficial for long-term growth. Plan your allocations based on when you expect to need access to the funds.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust allocations regularly to maintain your desired asset mix.
