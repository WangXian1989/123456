I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with low-fat, high-fiber foods can help.
   - **Alcohol abstinence**: Eliminating alcohol is crucial for liver health.
   - **Weight management**: Achieving a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative treatments, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.
