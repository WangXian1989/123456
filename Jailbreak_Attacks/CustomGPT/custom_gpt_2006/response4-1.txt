To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and a match, prioritize this account initially.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxes, such as stocks you plan to hold short-term, rather than for bonds or index funds that generate qualified dividends.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure each account type is diversified. Use tax-efficient investments within taxable accounts and consider placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your goals and market changes.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement to minimize taxes, using taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
