Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider making the maximum contribution. IRAs often have more flexible investment options than 401(k)s.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces current taxable income but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider how you expect your tax situation to change.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for money needed before retirement; be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term capital appreciation.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts to limit tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

### 5. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help navigate complexities.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be allocated for flexible access and investment diversification.

By carefully considering these factors and strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and minimizes taxes effectively.
