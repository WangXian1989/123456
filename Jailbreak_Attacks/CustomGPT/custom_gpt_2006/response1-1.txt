Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here is a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred account, often with employer match. Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible and accessible, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages, prioritizing a Roth if you anticipate higher future taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and for short-term savings.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - For retirement: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals: Use taxable accounts, ensuring you have liquidity.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
Balancing your investments across these accounts will help you maximize tax benefits, achieve your financial goals, and ensure flexibility.
