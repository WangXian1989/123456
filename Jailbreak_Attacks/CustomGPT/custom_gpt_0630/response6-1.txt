Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider funding this account as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Traditional accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) offer tax-deferred growth but will be taxed upon withdrawal. 
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, but they require careful tax planning due to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more stable or income-generating investments to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts; rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

By carefully strategizing your contributions and monitoring your allocations, you can effectively distribute your financial resources among these accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
