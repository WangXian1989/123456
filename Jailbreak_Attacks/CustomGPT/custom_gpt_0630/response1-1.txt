When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits:** 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages (pre-tax contributions for 401(k) and tax-deferred growth for both).
   - Check if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) and contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (401(k), IRA). Prioritize funding accounts that provide the highest tax benefits first.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Consider your need for access to funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties, whereas 401(k) and IRA withdrawals before certain ages may incur penalties and taxes.

4. **Investment Growth:**
   - Focus on aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth, while using more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts, assessing risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Future Tax Considerations:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to rise in the future, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals will be tax-free in retirement.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
