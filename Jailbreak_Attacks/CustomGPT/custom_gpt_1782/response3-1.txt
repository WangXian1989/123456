Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often provide more investment choices than 401(k) plans.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k). Focus on maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, especially if you need liquidity or freedom to withdraw without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and growth effectively.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and tax implications.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
