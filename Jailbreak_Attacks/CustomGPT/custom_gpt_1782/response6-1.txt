Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your income and tax bracket.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; taxes due upon withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but can provide flexibility.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. 
- Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. Facility for Withdrawals
- **Short-term needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
- **Long-term goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

Align your distribution with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance to maximize growth and minimize taxes over time.
