The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before investing heavily.

4. **Continue to Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you're on track with your IRA, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions next.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility in withdrawals and investing in tax-efficient funds or stocks. This is useful if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement age.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Generally, stocks are better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be more appropriate in taxable accounts due to their lower tax implications.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Keep an eye on tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
