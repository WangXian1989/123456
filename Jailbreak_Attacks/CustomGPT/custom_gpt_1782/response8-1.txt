Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out your IRA**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). IRAs offer tax benefits that can compound your savings.
   - **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Consider taxable accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can be useful for more flexible withdrawal options.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Monitor your tax situation. Withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts can push you into a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your investments periodically to ensure you maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before prioritizing investments.

### Conclusion
The best approach balances contributions according to benefits, tax implications, and your specific financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
