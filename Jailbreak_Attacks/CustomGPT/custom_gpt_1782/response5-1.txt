Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, contribute to your IRA, particularly if it offers tax deductions or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). 

3. **Consider Taxes**: Taxable accounts are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. For long-term investments, hold them for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

4. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, and prioritize accounts where you can maximize contributions.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to adjust based on performance, changes in income, or life events.

7. **Speak with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consult a financial professional.

This strategy can help you leverage the benefits of each account type effectively.
