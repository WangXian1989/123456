Distributing your money among a **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** requires a balanced approach based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. This can be held in a high-yield savings account.

### 3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (though taxes on gains apply).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free. Use bond funds or lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account. This helps with dollar-cost averaging and ensures consistent investing over time.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money depends on your financial situation and goals. By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and maintaining a diversified portfolio, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
