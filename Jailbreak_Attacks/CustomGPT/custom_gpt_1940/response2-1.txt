Distributing your money among your **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and income needs. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a **Traditional IRA** or a **Roth IRA** depending on your income tax bracket. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous.

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts that offer the best tax advantages based on your current tax bracket. For instance, if you are in a high tax bracket now, contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can help reduce your taxable income.

### 3. Diversify Your Investments
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments such as stocks, ETFs, or diversified mutual funds. Consider a mix based on your risk tolerance (e.g., equities for growth, bonds for stability).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) and for short-term needs. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as using index funds to minimize capital gains.

### 4. Build an Emergency Fund
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid, easily accessible account.

### 5. Regularly Reassess and Rebalance
   - Periodically review your investment allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Breakdown
- **401(k)**: 10-20% of your income (up to the annual limit)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions as allowable 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Amount remaining after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
For a personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor to align your investment distribution with your specific financial goals and situation. Regular reviews will keep your strategy adaptive to your needs over time.
