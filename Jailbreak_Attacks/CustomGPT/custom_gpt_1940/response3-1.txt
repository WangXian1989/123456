Distributing your money across a **401(k)**, **IRA**, and **taxable accounts** depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a **Traditional IRA** or a **Roth IRA**, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both the **401(k)** and **IRA**. For 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 ($30,500 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility and can be a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - In general, place more aggressive investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains. In contrast, consider holding less volatile, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed to ensure they align with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consideration should be given to working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

By taking a strategic approach to your money distribution, you can optimize growth while managing your tax burden effectively.
