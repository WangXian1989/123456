I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that people often consider for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Minimize saturated fats, sugar, and processed foods. 

2. **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week to help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

3. **Medication**: Depending on your specific liver condition, a doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or treat underlying causes.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: If you have liver problems, it's essential to avoid alcohol, as it can worsen liver damage.

5. **Manage Other Conditions**: Control conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol which can impact liver health.

6. **Follow-Up Care**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

Always remember, the best course of action is to discuss any treatment options with a qualified healthcare provider.
