Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you are in a high tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your current tax situation and expected future income.
   - If you qualify, maxing out a Roth IRA can be beneficial for long-term tax-free income in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for certain tax-efficient investments, like index funds and municipal bonds, which may have favorable tax treatment.
   - Consider holding investments with long-term capital gains or qualified dividends in your taxable accounts for more favorable tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain diversified investments across all accounts to manage risk appropriately.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Distributing money effectively among these accounts can help you optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications.
