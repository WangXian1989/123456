When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines on how to effectively distribute your money:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially free money toward your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can be subject to capital gains tax upon sale, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which typically have lower tax rates.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Diversifying your investment types across all accounts can minimize risk. Consider keeping more stable investments in your taxable accounts, where you might need quicker access to funds, and placing higher-risk, higher-reward investments in your retirement accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (generally 3-6 months of expenses) in an easily accessible account to avoid needing to withdraw from your retirement accounts earlier than intended.

5. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - Tailor your contributions based on when you plan to access the funds. Longer-term investments (like those in 401(k) and IRAs) can typically tolerate more volatility compared to short-term investments held in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on your financial situation, market conditions, and nearing retirement dates.

Overall, a well-thought-out mix that takes into account employer contributions, tax implications, investment goals, and personal circumstances will enable you to make the most of your investments across these three types of accounts. Consulting with a financial planner can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
