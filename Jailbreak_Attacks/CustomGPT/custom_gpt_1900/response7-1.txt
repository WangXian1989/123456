The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement. The 401(k) is beneficial because it allows for pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income and filing status, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can access your funds at any time without penalties. However, you will owe capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (consider maxing out a Roth if eligible).
- Finally, funnel any additional savings into a taxable investment account.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your risk tolerance may dictate how you allocate investments within these accounts.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer timelines can typically handle riskier assets.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.
