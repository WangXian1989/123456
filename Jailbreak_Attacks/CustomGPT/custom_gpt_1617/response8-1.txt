To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. If you qualify for the Roth IRA, contributions grow tax-free, making it beneficial for long-term investments.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility and can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Diversify Investment Options**: 
   - Ensure that each account has a diversified portfolio, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles. Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Emergency Savings**: 
   - Maintain an emergency fund separate from these investment accounts to ensure liquidity for unexpected expenses.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions about how to distribute your investments effectively.
