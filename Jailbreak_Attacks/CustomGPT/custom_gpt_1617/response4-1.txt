To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you’re maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and continue to contribute up to the annual limit. 

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA limits, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for liquidity and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation fits your risk tolerance and investment goals. It may be beneficial to hold more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, whereas bonds or less volatile investments could be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will be taxed in retirement. 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Continuously monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all three account types, considering market conditions and personal financial changes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances, retirement goals, and tax situation.

This structured approach balances contributions across your accounts while considering tax implications and maximizing growth potential.
