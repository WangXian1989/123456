Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline for an effective distribution strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the annual limit: For 2023, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute as much as you can while considering your budget.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth vs. Traditional IRA: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since contributions are made after taxes, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you need tax deductions now, consider a Traditional IRA.
   - Contribute to the annual limit: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). If possible, try to max out your IRA contributions after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for flexible investments: Taxable accounts are suitable for investments you might need access to before retirement age, as there are no early withdrawal penalties compared to retirement accounts. 
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments: Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends, long-term capital gains, or tax-free income (e.g., municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Balance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation: Your financial needs and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your contributions to ensure you're on track.
   - Focus on diversification: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and investment vehicles to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a personalized strategy based on your specific goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following this distribution strategy, you can optimize your retirement savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
