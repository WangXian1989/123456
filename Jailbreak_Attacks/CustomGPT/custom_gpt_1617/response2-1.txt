The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts have different tax implications (capital gains, interest income). After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, prioritize taxable accounts for investments where you expect to generate long-term growth (to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates) or for more liquid investments.

3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), put a higher percentage into your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, consider utilizing your taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type, tailored for your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on performance and changing financial goals to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial circumstances.

Ultimately, your ideal distribution will be unique to your individual situation, so it's important to assess your objectives, risk tolerance, and time frame.
