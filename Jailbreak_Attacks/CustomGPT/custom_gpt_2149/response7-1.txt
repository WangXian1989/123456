Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions may lower your taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
 
### 3. **Fund 401(k) Further**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions if you haven't maxed it out (2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This allows flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider different asset classes in each account type. Generally, keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth, while holding lower-growth, income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Each individual's situation varies, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
