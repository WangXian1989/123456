Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial for tax planning.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. These may be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Tax Impact**:
   - Having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts allows for flexibility in retirement. This can help you manage your tax burden based on your income levels at that time.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, you might take a more aggressive approach in your 401(k) and IRA because they are designed for long-term growth. Taxable accounts might be used for more conservative investments if you plan to access funds sooner.

5. **Regularly Reevaluate**:
   - Life changes, tax laws, and market conditions can impact your strategy. Review and adjust your distribution plan regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure or your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can effectively balance your contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
