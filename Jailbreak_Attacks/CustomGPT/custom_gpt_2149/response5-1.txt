Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs are taxed on contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are after-tax investments. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but may involve capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account before heavily investing in these options.

4. **Diversify Assets**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to reflect changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider meeting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Adapting these strategies to your unique financial landscape will help you optimize your investment distribution.
