I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver issues. Treatment often depends on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, options may include:

- **Lifestyle Changes:** Weight management, a balanced diet, and regular exercise.
- **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent check-ups to assess liver function.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
