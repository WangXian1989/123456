I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and increased physical activity, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Regular monitoring and follow-ups are also crucial. Please seek medical guidance for specific recommendations tailored to your condition.
