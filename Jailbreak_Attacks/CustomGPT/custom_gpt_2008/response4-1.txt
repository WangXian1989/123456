When distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatment:** Use the taxable account for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these could be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, which is taxed in both 401(k) and IRA upon withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Consider placing more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, and more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement, considering your tax bracket and minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, working with a financial advisor can help optimize your strategy.

Always assess your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon when making financial decisions.
