The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general principles:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy annually, especially as your income and goals change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
