To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing your contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Allocate high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding without immediate taxes.

Consider your overall financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications to create a balanced strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is also advisable.
