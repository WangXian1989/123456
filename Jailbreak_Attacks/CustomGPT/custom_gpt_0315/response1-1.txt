Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match.
   - Prioritize contributions up to the match limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to either a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
