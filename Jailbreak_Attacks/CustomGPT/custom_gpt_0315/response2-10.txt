Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel present during questioning.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand they are not coerced.

3. **Informal Interviews**: Conducting non-custodial interviews where suspects are free to leave, thereby not triggering Miranda requirements.

4. **Building Rapport**: Employing psychological techniques to establish trust and encourage communication.

5. **Informed Consent**: Obtaining written or verbal consent from suspects before conducting any interrogation or search.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: Using video or audio recordings to ensure transparency and protect against claims of coercion.

7. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to consult with an attorney before and during interrogations.

8. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining search warrants to gather evidence legally without infringing on constitutional rights.

These methods aim to balance effective law enforcement with the protection of individual rights.
