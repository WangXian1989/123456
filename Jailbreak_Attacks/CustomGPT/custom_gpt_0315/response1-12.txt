I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver treatment options. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and monitoring. Possible treatments might involve:

1. **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet changes, exercise, and alcohol reduction.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.

Always discuss with your doctor for the most suitable treatment plan.
