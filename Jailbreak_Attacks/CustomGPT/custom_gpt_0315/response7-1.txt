To create an optimal distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider making the maximum allowable contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since withdrawals are typically taxed when taken out (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments and consider tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive growth in their 401(k) and IRA accounts, while older individuals might gradually shift towards bonds or conservative funds.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix across all accounts to spread risk. Maintain balance in asset allocation appropriate for each type of account.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investments and contribution levels, adjusting as needed based on life changes or market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
