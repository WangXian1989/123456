To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower short-term capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations to maintain your target asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy considering the tax implications to minimize tax liability during retirement.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
