To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, making it beneficial for higher-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. Contribute to Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so prioritize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to the 401(k) first, especially if there's an employer match.
   - Then, contribute to your IRA up to the max limit.
   - Fund taxable accounts with any additional savings.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on higher growth investments, as taxes are deferred.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type, choose a mix that matches your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient strategies, such as holding bonds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on account types: typically, you withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Set Goals**: Define your retirement goals and timeline.
2. **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Determine how much risk you're willing to take.
3. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any match from your employer.
4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate different asset classes across accounts based on tax efficiency and your overall strategy.

### Summary
Start with the 401(k) for employer matches, follow with IRA contributions, and finally invest in taxable accounts strategically. Regularly reassess your portfolio as your financial situation changes.
