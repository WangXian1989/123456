I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about common liver treatment options. Here are some typical approaches based on different liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention in conditions like cirrhosis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver failure or cirrhosis.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but consult a doctor before using them.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
