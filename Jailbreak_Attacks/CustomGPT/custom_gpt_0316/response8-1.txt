Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to the limit.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains rather than income, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Hold Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, it’s often beneficial to hold bonds in your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, start with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and maximize your retirement savings.
