Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals under certain conditions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Better for short-term goals, as they are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments with less volatility.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on investments that can benefit from tax deferral, like bonds or high-growth stocks.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Ensure diversification in asset classes to manage risk effectively.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (up to company match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (current limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds, focusing on investments suited for your time horizon.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess your investments and adjust contributions as your situation, goals, or tax laws change.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
