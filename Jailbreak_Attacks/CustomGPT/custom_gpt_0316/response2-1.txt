Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider funding a **Traditional IRA** or **Roth IRA**. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth and withdrawals, great for younger investors.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**
   - Once your IRA contributions are maximized (subject to income limits), increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 5. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments as capital gains and income are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Goals and Needs**
   - Assess your **time horizon**, **risk tolerance**, and **retirement goals**, and adjust contributions accordingly. 

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions strategically based on employer benefits and tax advantages, while maintaining a balanced approach tailored to your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance can further enhance your strategy.
