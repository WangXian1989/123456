Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Typically allows higher contributions than IRAs (e.g., $22,500 for 2023).
   - **IRA:** Limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **IRA:** Choose between traditional (taxed on withdrawal) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings and dividends taxed annually.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) for potential growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for quick access.

### 4. **Suggested Distribution Approach**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA:** After maxing the match, consider funding an IRA.
   - **Additional Contributions:** Allocate extra funds back to the 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your tax situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50% (max out contributions, including employer match)
- **IRA:** 20% (choose Roth or Traditional based on tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% (for flexibility and immediate access)

### Conclusion
Adjust your strategy based on your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Regularly review and rebalance as needed.
