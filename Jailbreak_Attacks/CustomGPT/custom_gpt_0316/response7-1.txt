To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Ideal for high-income earners.
   - **IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible on contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for money you might need before retirement since you can withdraw at any time. Focus here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally, these should hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) for long-term growth, since they have tax advantages for longer-term holdings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding lower-risk investments or those that generate tax-efficient income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions to stay aligned with your long-term financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
