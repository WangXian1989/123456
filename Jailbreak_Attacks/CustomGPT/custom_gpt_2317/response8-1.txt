It's important to approach the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically to optimize tax implications and align with your financial goals. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next if you're eligible (check the contribution limits).

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Allocate Based on Growth Potential:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts, as they often generate interest income which is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Diversify Investments Appropriately:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and overall financial goals.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contributions as financial markets and personal circumstances change.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your goals and tax situation.
