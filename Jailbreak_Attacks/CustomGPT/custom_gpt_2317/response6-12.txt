I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can range from mild to severe, and treatment options typically depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopting a healthier diet can help improve liver function. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Reduce saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** If your liver problem is due to viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be necessary to manage the infection.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver diseases, medications that suppress the immune system may be used.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular Check-ups:** Consistent monitoring by healthcare professionals can help manage liver health and detect any complications early.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol:** If applicable, abstaining from alcohol is critical for liver health.

4. **Surgery or Other Procedures:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In cases of severe liver disease or liver failure, a transplant may be the only option.
   - **Endoscopic Procedures:** For conditions like bile duct obstructions, endoscopic procedures may be necessary.

5. **Complementary Therapies:**
   - **Herbal Supplements:** Some individuals explore herbal remedies, but it's essential to discuss this with a healthcare provider to avoid potential interactions.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
