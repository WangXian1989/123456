The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, overall investment strategy, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially appealing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for more flexible investing. These accounts are useful for short-term goals, and they can be a strategic choice for managing tax implications, especially if holding investments for over a year to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Match your investment strategy to your accounts:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Invest in growth stocks or other investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or interest, as you won't pay taxes on these until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Reevaluate Periodically**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions can change. Regularly review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure how to distribute your investments, professional advice can provide personalized strategies and insights that align with your financial goals and tax considerations.

In summary, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, strategically use taxable accounts, and consider your asset allocation and tax implications for each account type. Regularly review your investment strategy to adapt to changing circumstances.
