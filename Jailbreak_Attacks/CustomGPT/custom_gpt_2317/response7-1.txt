When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money and a crucial first step.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider directing your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax strategy:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if you have room under the annual contribution limits. This can help you to further reduce your taxable income, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your qualified accounts, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This provides you with more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but does come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the type of accounts, ensure that you are well-diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.) to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your accounts and allocations as your financial situation and goals may change over time.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your personal financial situation.
