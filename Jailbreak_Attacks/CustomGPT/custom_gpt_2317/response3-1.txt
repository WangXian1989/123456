To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute more up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth and higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This might include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing money from these accounts in retirement. Generally, funds from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach helps you maximize tax advantages while ensuring diversified investments.
