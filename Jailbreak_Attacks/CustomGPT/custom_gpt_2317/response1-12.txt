I'm not a doctor, but there are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are vital to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Viral Hepatitis Treatments**: If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be appropriate.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
