I can’t provide specific financial advice, but I can offer some general tips on how you might think about distributing your money:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer matching contributions first since this is essentially free money. Consider how much you can afford to contribute and how it fits into your overall retirement strategy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can give you tax deductions on your contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Understand the contribution limits and eligibility requirements for each.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may want to access before retirement or to take advantage of capital gains rates. Keep in mind that you’ll be taxed on dividends and gains, so it’s wise to consider tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. It might be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your needs.
