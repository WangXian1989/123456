Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA next. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might benefit more from a Roth IRA. If you expect your income to decrease in retirement, a Traditional IRA could be advantageous.
   - **Withdrawal strategies:** Plan for when you'll need access to funds. 401(k) and IRA funds come with penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not.

### 3. **Consider Investment Horizons:**
   - **Long-term growth:** Use retirement accounts for long-term growth, where tax advantages can compound over time.
   - **Short-term needs:** Park any funds you may need sooner in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification of Assets:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable accounts:** 20%

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.
