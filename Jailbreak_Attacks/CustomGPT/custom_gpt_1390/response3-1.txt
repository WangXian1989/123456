Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Debt Consideration**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing more.

### 4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions (up to the limit) if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals but keep in mind tax implications on capital gains.

### 6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired level.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific situation with a professionalâ€™s help.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: 10%-15% (including match)
2. **IRA**: Max contribution ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if over 50)
3. **Taxable Account**: Remainder, after meeting the above goals.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions that provide the greatest long-term benefits before diverging into taxable accounts.
