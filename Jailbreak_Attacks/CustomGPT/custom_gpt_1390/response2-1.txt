Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Retirement Timeline**
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus more on aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRAs. Allocate more towards equities in these accounts.
   - **Mid-Career**: Strike a balance between growth and stability. Diversify within your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for shorter-term goals or for withdrawals that won't incur penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: These are best for high-growth investments, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and life changes. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired investment strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailored advice can help you optimize your distribution based on personal financial circumstances and goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable Account: 20%

Adjust percentages based on your specific needs and goals.
