To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and income taxes on dividends.

### 2. Optimize Asset Allocation
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) since taxes are deferred or managed in the long term.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate more stable investments (e.g., bonds or dividend stocks) to minimize annual tax impacts.

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before other accounts.
- **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA if eligible and consider the best tax strategy for your situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to save for goals occurring before retirement.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing
- Periodically review and adjust your investments in these accounts to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

### 5. Withdrawals Strategy
- In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to manage tax liabilities effectively, often starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Conclusion
A well-structured balance among these accounts can optimize growth while minimizing tax burdens over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.
