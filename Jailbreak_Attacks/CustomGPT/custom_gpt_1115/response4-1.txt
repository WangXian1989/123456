Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax income, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually, but you can also strategically sell investments for long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Location:**
   - **High Growth Investments:** Allocate high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds and Income-Generating Assets:** Consider placing these in tax-sheltered accounts due to their higher interest income, which could be taxed at higher rates in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - If your goal is retirement, prioritize retirement accounts. If you're saving for a shorter-term goal (like a house), taxable accounts may offer more liquidity.

### 5. **Adjust As You Age:**
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA to preserve capital, while keeping some growth potential in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
The best strategy includes balancing your immediate needs with future goals, while also considering tax implications. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
