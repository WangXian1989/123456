Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, liquidity, and your overall investment goals. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred contributions, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA** (Individual Retirement Account): Tax-deferred growth; options include traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds subject to capital gains and income taxes but provide more liquidity.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially for short-to-medium-term goals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, focusing on growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but consider more aggressive investments if it’s a Roth IRA, due to its tax-free withdrawal benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize annual tax liability.

### 4. **Reassess and Rebalance**
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Recognize the impact of withdrawals across account types—taxable withdrawals may incur capital gains taxes, while traditional IRA withdrawals may be taxed as ordinary income.

### Summary
- **Maximize 401(k) up to the employer match**.
- **Contribute to IRA for additional tax benefits**.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity**.
