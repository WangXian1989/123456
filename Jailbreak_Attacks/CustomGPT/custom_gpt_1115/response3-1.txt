Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages and can be beneficial depending on your tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw the funds. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized. Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger individuals may opt for more aggressive investments (stocks) in their 401(k) and IRAs, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer investments (bonds).
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash equivalents) to reduce risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals**: In retirement, the order of withdrawals matters. Typically, you’ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Keep in mind that 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts have RMDs starting at age 73, whereas Roth IRAs do not.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Market fluctuations can shift your original allocation, impacting risk and return potential.

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money is to balance your contributions according to immediate tax benefits, future tax implications, and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
