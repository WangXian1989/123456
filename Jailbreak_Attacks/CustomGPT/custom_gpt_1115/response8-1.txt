Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Goal:** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Goal:** Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - **Goal:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if you can.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Goal:** Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility and shorter-term goals. These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties but come with capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Distribute funds based on your current and expected future tax brackets. For instance, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

### 6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) suitable for your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 7. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust contributions based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 10-15% of salary (enough to get the match)
- **IRA:** Maximum contribution if possible (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining savings or surplus income

### Conclusion
It’s essential to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight and guidance.
