To efficiently distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you’ve maxed out the above accounts, consider putting additional funds into your 401(k) or taxable account based on your short-term vs. long-term goals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred. 
   - Use your taxable account for more conservative investments, as they will incur capital gains taxes when sold.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, which you’ll face with your 401(k) withdrawals.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable account to offset gains.

5. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then strategically using taxable accounts, you can optimize your investment strategy and potentially save on taxes in the long run.
