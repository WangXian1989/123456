To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Understand that interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at higher ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, it's beneficial to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes for longer periods.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in your taxable account, where tax rates may be lower.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially if you are many years from retirement.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and goals. Adjust based on performance, changes in income, and retirement timelines.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out the employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit if feasible.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for deductible contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for taxable investments, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

This balanced approach will help you build a robust retirement portfolio while optimizing tax benefits.
