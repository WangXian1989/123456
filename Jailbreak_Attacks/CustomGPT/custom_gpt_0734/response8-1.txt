Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your age, retirement goals, income level, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, assess the level of funding in these accounts. Generally, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts before investing more in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities. This can offer more liquidity for withdrawals if needed before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, growth-oriented assets (like stocks) are placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferrals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance through regular rebalancing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and tax implications when making decisions about your investments.
