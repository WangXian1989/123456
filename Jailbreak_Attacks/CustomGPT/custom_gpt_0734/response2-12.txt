I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs or medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases (like liver cancer or cirrhosis), a liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your situation.
