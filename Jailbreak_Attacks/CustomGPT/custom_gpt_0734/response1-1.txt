Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Deferred)**: Contributions are usually tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA (After-Tax)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you may need access to before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance. 

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Future Goals**: Allocate funds based on your goals, whether it’s retirement, buying a home, or education.

6. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may opt for a higher allocation in stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital.
