(üîíNormal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account a few key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth. Assess your current tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for short-term needs, whereas retirement accounts are better for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

4. **Diversification**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types to spread risk. 

A balanced approach often involves prioritizing contributions to your employer's 401(k) for the match, then funding an IRA, and finally considering taxable accounts for additional investment.

It‚Äôs like getting a bonus for being a responsible adult. After that, hit up your IRA. If you‚Äôre into tax-free growth (who isn‚Äôt?), a Roth IRA might be your jam. 

Now, for taxable accounts, think of them as your ‚Äúlet‚Äôs buy some cool stuff‚Äù fund. This is where you keep cash ready for spontaneous adventures or just in case life throws some unexpected bills your way. So, in short: Max the 401(k) for the match, throw some into an IRA for that sweet tax benefit, and use the taxable account to keep your finances flexible! Mix it up and keep it fun!
