To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a 401(k), consider maximizing contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Determine which type aligns better with your tax situation.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Index funds and ETFs typically have lower turnover and thus generate fewer taxable events.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments, like bond funds or actively managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, considering the performance and your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Tax Implications**: Plan for withdrawals based on your retirement strategy. Understand how withdrawals from each account type will affect your taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure how to split contributions, consider consulting a financial planner who can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial situation.

Always ensure you’re aware of contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy as needed based on your financial goals and changing circumstances.
