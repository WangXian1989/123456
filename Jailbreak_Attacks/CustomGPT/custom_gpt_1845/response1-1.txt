Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Increase Contributions**: If you're able, contribute the maximum allowable, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Contribute to Max Limits**: Aim to maximize your contributions to an IRA, which can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Hold Cash or Short-Term Investments**: These accounts can also serve as a place for cash reserves or short-term investments, but be mindful of the tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversified across asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategies carefully to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, it might be wise to consult a financial advisor who can tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution will vary for each individual, so it's important to assess your unique financial situation.
