To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant taxable income, such as bonds or high-dividend stocks, or for money you may need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider your investment time horizon and adjust your asset allocation accordingly.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can be valuable, especially to navigate specific tax implications and investment strategies tailored to your situation.

These steps can help optimize your retirement savings while considering your overall financial goals.
