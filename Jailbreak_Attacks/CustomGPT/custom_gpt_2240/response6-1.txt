To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and any employer match first. Then, consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts for Growth**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Income-Generating Investments**: Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to optimize your tax benefits each year.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution of funds that aligns with your financial goals while minimizing taxes.
