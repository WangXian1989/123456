Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends youâ€™d prefer to be taxed at long-term capital gains rates.
   - Hold assets that appreciate in value in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes during growth.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.
   - Bonds might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to higher tax rates on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### General Strategy:
- Contribute to your 401(k) to the match limit.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Place remaining funds in taxable accounts.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Given the complexity of individual situations, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your needs. 

This structured approach can help you optimize your investment returns while minimizing taxes.
