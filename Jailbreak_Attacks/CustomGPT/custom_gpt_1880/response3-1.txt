The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income more frequently, like bonds or actively managed funds. This keeps your tax-advantaged accounts focused on growth-oriented investments.

4. **Balance and Diversify**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly reassess your allocation between accounts and adjust your contributions as needed. 

Working with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
