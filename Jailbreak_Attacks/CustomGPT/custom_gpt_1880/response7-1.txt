To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Optimization**: 
   - Use your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize maxing out any employer match before contributing to other accounts.
   - Focus on tax-advantaged IRAs (Roth or Traditional) depending on your income situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Keep relatively high-tax investments (like bonds or high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and place lower tax investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Diversification Across Accounts**: 
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified. This means maintaining a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts instead of concentrating similar investments in one type of account.

3. **Investment Horizon**: 
   - Consider your time horizon for withdrawals. Keep more aggressive investments in accounts where your money will grow for a longer time (like a 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative assets in taxable accounts if you plan to access those funds sooner.

4. **Fees and Expenses**: 
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each account. Some 401(k) plans have high fees; if yours does, it might be better to contribute only enough to get the match and invest more heavily in IRAs or taxable accounts that offer lower fees.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly assess your investments across all accounts to ensure they still align with your goals and risk tolerance. Market fluctuations may shift your asset allocation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
