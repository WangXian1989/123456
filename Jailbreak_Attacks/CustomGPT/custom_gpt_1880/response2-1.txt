Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." The contributions reduce your taxable income, giving you a tax advantage.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to get tax deductions. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments where you anticipate needing access before retirement or those that may generate tax-efficient capital gains.

### 3. Diversify Investments Across Accounts
   - Allocate different types of investments based on the account's tax implications. For instance:
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since taxes are deferred.

### 4. Regularly Reassess Your Strategy
   - Monitor your financial situation and adjust contributions as needed. Revisit your allocation strategy annually or during major life changes (like a job change, marriage, or a new child).

### Conclusion
By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can maximize growth and minimize taxes, aligning with your long-term financial goals. If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.
