Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Fill Your 401(k):** Once you've maxed out your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This can be advantageous if it offers a wider range of investment options or lower fees compared to other funds.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable investment accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement age. They also allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding less tax-efficient investments, like bonds or REITs, in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing more tax-efficient investments, like stocks or ETFs, in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations across all accounts to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy suited to your individual circumstances.
