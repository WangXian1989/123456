Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth. For traditional IRAs, you'll benefit from tax deductions now, but be aware of taxes upon withdrawal.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Contributing more to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) can reduce your taxable income for the year. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate minimal taxable income, like long-term capital gains. This can be an effective way to manage your overall tax burden.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a balanced investment strategy in each account. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments (stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes, while keeping more stable investments (bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts, particularly during retirement. The order of withdrawals can impact your tax rate and financial needs.

By prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts, and considering your overall tax implications and goals, you can more effectively distribute your investments for growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
