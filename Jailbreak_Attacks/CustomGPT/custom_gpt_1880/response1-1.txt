Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It’s essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation. IRAs can offer tax benefits that help your money grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous since you pay taxes on contributions now and withdraw tax-free later. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might make more sense, allowing you to defer taxes until retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and accessing funds without penalties, but they don't have the same tax advantages.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified—balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Regularly revisit your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. This can help you stay on track towards your long-term financial objectives.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your personal circumstances.
