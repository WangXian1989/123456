Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are general strategies for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Contributions**: Maximize employer match if offered, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth); consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Decide between Traditional or Roth based on tax implications. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if qualified.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Investment Strategy**: Similar to 401(k), focus on a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Choices**: Use this account for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before aggressively investing.
- **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically based on market conditions and your financial goals.
