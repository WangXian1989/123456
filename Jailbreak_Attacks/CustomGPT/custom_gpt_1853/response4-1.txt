When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching, which is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free at withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains apply. This account is flexible for withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you know the annual contribution limits for each account (401(k) and IRA).

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments. 
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access sooner.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future tax situation. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxed as income, while qualified distributions from a Roth IRA may be tax-free.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to mitigate risk.

### Suggested Steps:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (especially if considering a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maxed or if limits are hit, channel additional funds into taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income until employer match is met, then increase if possible.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions where possible (as of 2023, $6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for over).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional savings or investment income beyond retirement accounts.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
