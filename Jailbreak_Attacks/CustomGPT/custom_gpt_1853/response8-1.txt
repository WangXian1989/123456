Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can (the IRS limit is $22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (income limits apply). Max contribution is $6,500 in 2024 ($7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that might benefit from lower capital gains tax rates (long-term investments held for over a year). 
   - This account can also be a place for non-tax-advantaged investments, like individual stocks or bonds.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts to manage risk. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, while taxable accounts may offer tax benefits on dividends and long-term capital gains.
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals considering tax brackets to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This approach can help you balance tax efficiency and flexibility while working towards your financial goals.
