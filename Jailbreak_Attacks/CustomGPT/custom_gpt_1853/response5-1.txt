Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for potential tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider your tax bracket when deciding between Roth and Traditional. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be better.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: After maximizing the match, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you have excess funds. This helps lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable investment account for additional savings. This allows for greater access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are suitable for long-term growth, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) can provide stability.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market conditions and your personal financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
