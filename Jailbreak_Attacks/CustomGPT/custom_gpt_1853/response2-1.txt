Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 per account ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Roth Options**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are great for goals with shorter timelines, as you can access funds without penalties.
   - **Diversification**: Use this account for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and interest income.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing heavily.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fund your 401(k) to get the match, then contribute to your IRA before going to taxable accounts.
3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Conclusion
The best distribution is a balanced approach based on your specific circumstances. Consider meeting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your needs.
