To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine when you plan to retire and your income needs.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Understand how withdrawals will impact your tax bracket.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA depending on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Investment Choices**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Account Types**: Use your 401(k) for more aggressive investments, as you can typically access these funds later without penalties.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access**: Keep an emergency fund in a taxable account or high-yield savings account for easy access.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommendations:
- Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) for the employer match.
- Consider maxing out your IRA contributions each year.
- Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to align with changing goals and market conditions.

By carefully crafting your strategy around these principles, you can maximize growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
