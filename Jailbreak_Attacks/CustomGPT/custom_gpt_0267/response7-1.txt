The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to reach that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. These are good for high-income years.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you won't pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts** are taxed on capital gains and dividends in the year you realize them, so consider using them for goals that may come before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy, you might want to keep more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your IRA) since they'll have more time to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your investments remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance by periodically reviewing and adjusting your allocations across accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Always keep some liquid savings in a taxable account for emergencies, separate from retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Think about any other financial goals (like buying a home or education for children) that might dictate how much you place in taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your individual circumstances.
