I'm here to help you learn CSS in a clear and straightforward manner. We'll cover four key topics: CSS as a cascading stylesheet, typography, colors, and layout. By the end of this lesson, you should have a good understanding of how to use CSS to design and style web pages effectively.

Let's get started with our first module: "CSS is a cascading stylesheet."

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a way to add style to HTML tags. While HTML structures a webpage with elements, CSS modifies the appearance of those elements. Browsers often apply default styles to HTML tags (like margins and font sizes), but these can be overridden with your own CSS.

The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied. If multiple CSS rules target the same element, the rule that is most specific takes priority. Understanding cascading is crucial, as it affects how your styles interact with one another.

CSS can be applied in three main ways:
1. **Inline styles**: Applying styles directly inside an HTML element using the "style" attribute.
   ```html
   <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World</h1>
   ```
   
2. **Internal styles**: Placing CSS rules within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
   ```html
   <style>
       h1 {
           color: blue;
       }
   </style>
   ```

3. **External styles**: Linking to an external CSS file using a `<link>` tag in the HTML.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

Remember, getting typography, colors, and layout consistent across your products is essential for effective design. These are the key elements that help create a visually appealing experience.

Now, let's test your understanding of the first module with some questions!
