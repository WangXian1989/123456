I can help with general principles, but keep in mind that personal finance is subjective, and it's crucial to tailor your strategy based on individual goals and circumstances. Here’s a basic guideline:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money. Focus on this first before moving on to other accounts.

2. **IRA:** After maxing out your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, but contributions are made after-tax. A traditional IRA allows pre-tax contributions, reducing your current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've leveraged your 401(k) and IRA options, any additional funds can go into a taxable investment account. This provides flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalty or restrictions; however, be mindful of capital gains tax on profits.

**Diversity of Investments:** 

Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments. Spread your money across different asset classes—stocks, bonds, and real estate—to reduce risk.

**Prioritization:** 

1. Max out your 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Invest in taxable accounts.

Lastly, consider your time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals before finalizing your allocation. Consult a financial advisor if possible for personalized advice!
