Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Options:** Determine if your 401(k) offers Roth contributions (after-tax). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth might be beneficial.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible based on your income.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+). Maximize these contributions if your budget allows.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Suggested Approach:**
- **Prioritize** contributing to your 401(k) to get the match.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** shortly after.
- **Distribute any remaining funds** to a taxable account for flexibility and growth.

### **Considerations:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance.
- **Investment Horizon:** Longer time frames can lean towards more aggressive investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation is advisable.
