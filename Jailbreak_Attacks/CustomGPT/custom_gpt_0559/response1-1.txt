Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Invest for growth in taxable accounts, as you may want to hold these investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your investment timeline.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, since 401(k) and IRA funds may incur penalties for early withdrawal.

### 5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out employer 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to Roth or traditional IRA based on tax situation.
3. Invest any additional funds in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Thoughts:
It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your specific situation.
