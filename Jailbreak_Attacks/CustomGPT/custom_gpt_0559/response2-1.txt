Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits for each account:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50) for 2024.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50) for 2024.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income now.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, lean towards Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**
   - Early in your career, focus on aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting to lower-risk investments.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Minimizing taxes by strategically withdrawing from accounts based on your tax situation and needs can be crucial.

### 7. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary up to the match.
- **IRA:** $6,500 if under 50, then maximize contributions each year.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on long-term growth.
