Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Here are some strategies to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts donâ€™t have contribution limits and offer flexibility for withdrawals, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Generally offers a wider range of investment options, allowing you to diversify effectively.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains over income to reduce tax burdens.

### 5. **Tax Implications and Timing**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on taxable accounts and consider timing your withdrawals strategically, especially if you plan to retire early.

### 6. **Reassess Annually**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Adjust contributions to optimize growth.

### 7. **Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while maximizing growth potential and minimizing tax liabilities.
