I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or treat infections.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and can reduce fatty liver.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: If applicable, abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Following up with your healthcare provider for regular check-ups and liver function tests is important.

5. **Possible Procedures**: In some severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, in extreme situations, liver transplant might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
