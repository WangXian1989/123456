To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Pay off any high-interest debt before investing extensively.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - For tax-deferred growth, prioritize Traditional IRAs; for tax-free withdrawals, consider Roth IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, or for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income.

5. **Diverse Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your asset allocation in mind (stocks, bonds, etc.) and make sure to rebalance across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly impact the best strategy, so consider professional guidance.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
