To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation.
   - After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Allocate bonds or high-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (like a savings account) before committing all funds to investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance, goals, and market performance.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan can optimize tax efficiency and ensure alignment with your long-term financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
