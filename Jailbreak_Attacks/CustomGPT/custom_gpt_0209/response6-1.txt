Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. 

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investing in assets that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth; minimize distributions until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or emergencies, since they can offer more flexibility without tax penalties for withdrawals.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Invest aggressively in 401(k) and IRA if you have a longer time horizon.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to funds soon.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining income after maximizing retirement accounts

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
