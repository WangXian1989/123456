Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxes on earnings and dividends, but more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match as itâ€™s free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** If eligible, help diversify your tax advantages (traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Investments:** Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - In higher income years, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. In lower income years, consider Roth contributions.
   - Plan for future tax implications of withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Use different asset classes to spread risk across accounts. 
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and respond to changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on your financial goals, ensure a balanced mix across accounts, and regularly review your strategy as needed. For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.
