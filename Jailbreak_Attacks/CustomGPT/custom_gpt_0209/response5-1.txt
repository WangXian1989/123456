To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Then consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation).

2. **Tax efficiency**: Place investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments that yield long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

4. **Regular review**: Periodically reassess your allocations to account for market changes and personal financial goals.

5. **Consider withdrawals**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation.
