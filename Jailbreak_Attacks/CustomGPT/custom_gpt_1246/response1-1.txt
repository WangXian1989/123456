Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but your withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages, so try to keep higher-yield investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments (like stocks) that may be more volatile but offer greater growth potential.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for investments that generate regular income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to manage taxes effectively.

4. **Adjust for Your Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may favor a more aggressive mix (higher stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you get older, gradually shift toward more conservative investments (like bonds) to preserve capital.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Stay informed about your accounts' performance and reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing goals.
