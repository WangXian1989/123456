Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deductible now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. Roth accounts, however, are funded with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Generally, place investments expected to grow the most in your tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on those gains. 
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Ensure you have enough cash and liquid assets outside of retirement accounts for emergencies. This usually comes from your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Over time, your asset allocation might shift due to market movements. Periodically rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

Ultimately, you may want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help optimize your distribution strategy based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
