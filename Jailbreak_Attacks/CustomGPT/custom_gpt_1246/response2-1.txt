The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation now versus expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but may offer more flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties. Also, they can be beneficial for long-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating large amounts into retirement accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Your distribution strategy should align with your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you anticipate needing funds in the next few years, consider keeping more in taxable accounts.

A common approach might be to:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- Choose a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it can provide tax-free income in retirement.
- Invest additional funds in a taxable account as needed for various goals and for more accessible funds.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies based on your specific financial situation.
