I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgical procedures or liver transplantation. Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
