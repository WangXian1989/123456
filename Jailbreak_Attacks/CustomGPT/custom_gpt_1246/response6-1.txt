Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. Understand Each Account's Tax Implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. However, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are made with after-tax dollars. You'll pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

### 2. Consider Your Retirement Timeline and Goals:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you plan to access funds in the near future, prioritize your taxable account for liquidity while allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) if you can afford to do so, to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy:
   - **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially 'free money.'
   - **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA, focusing on a High-Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Account Contributions**: Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility and immediate access.

### 4. Rebalancing and Adjusting:
   - Re-evaluate your distribution annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable account to offset gains if needed.

### 5. Additional Considerations:
   - Delve into investment choices within these accounts, considering risk tolerance and desired asset allocation.
   - Stay informed about contribution limits and potential changes in tax policy that might affect your strategy.

### Conclusion:
Align your investment distribution strategy with your financial goals while being mindful of the different tax implications associated with each account type. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy is essential as your financial situation evolves.
