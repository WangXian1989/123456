I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that you consult a doctor or a specialist for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options will vary depending on the specific liver condition you are facing. Generally, they might include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medication, or in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
