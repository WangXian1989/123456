Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate significant capital gains (e.g., stocks, ETFs) and consider tax-efficient strategies like holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can effectively manage tax implications and align with your retirement goals.
