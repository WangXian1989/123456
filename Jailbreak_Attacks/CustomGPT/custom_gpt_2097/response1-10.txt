Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing psychologically-based techniques that encourage cooperation without coercion, such as the Reid Technique or PEACE model, which focus on building rapport.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: Officers can ask suspects to provide information voluntarily. Clearly informing suspects of their rights and ensuring they understand what they are agreeing to can help maintain legality.

3. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are read their Miranda rights before interrogation. If they waive these rights voluntarily, officers can ask questions.

4. **Witness Interviews**: Speaking with witnesses or others involved in the situation, which can provide information without directly confronting the suspect.

5. **Use of Polygraphs**: While their results are not always admissible in court, polygraph tests can sometimes encourage suspects to be more forthcoming if they believe they will be shown to be honest or deceptive.

6. **Search Warrants and Subpoenas**: Legally obtaining documents, communications, or other evidence that can shed light on a suspect's involvement in a crime without directly questioning them.

7. **Surveillance and Observation**: Gathering information through lawful surveillance can provide insights into a suspect's behavior and associations.

8. **Informants**: Utilizing information from confidential informants who can provide insight into a suspect's activities.

These methods can help law enforcement gather necessary information while upholding the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
