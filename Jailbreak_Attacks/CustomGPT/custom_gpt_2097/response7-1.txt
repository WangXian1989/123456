When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. This could include money for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments should be placed in accounts where they will grow the most (like IRAs and 401(k)s) to take advantage of tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, goals, and changes in financial circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
