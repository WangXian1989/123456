Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for tax deferral and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide current tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are likely to grow (e.g., stocks), as they benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Taxable accounts may be better suited for investments with lower growth potential or that generate regular income (e.g., bonds), due to capital gains and income tax implications.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might make sense to prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k) and traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you’re years away from retirement, you can take more risks in your tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, start reallocating to safer assets.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before focusing too heavily on retirement accounts.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
