Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want a tax deduction now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Fund an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. If you have extra funds, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use these accounts for goals that are shorter-term or if you need access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes. 

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This approach helps balance tax benefits while ensuring access to funds when needed. Adjust based on your personal circumstances.
