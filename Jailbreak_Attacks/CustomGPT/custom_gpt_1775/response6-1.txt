To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### **1. Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon selling. However, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### **2. Diversify Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Try to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income level, fully fund your IRA (whether traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you anticipate a higher tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### **3. Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Focus on heavier investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) as these are designed for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** If you have short-term financial goals, prioritize contributions to your taxable accounts.

By following these strategies, you'll create a balanced approach that maximizes your tax efficiency while supporting your long-term financial goals.
