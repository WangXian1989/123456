When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options available within each account type. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k):** The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
  
3. **Diversification Among Account Types:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus these accounts on long-term growth investments since withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate (for Traditional accounts).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate income (like dividends) or for any money you might need before retirement since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** 
   - If you're currently in a lower tax bracket, consider prioritizing Roth contributions (to either a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)), since you'll pay taxes on money now for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - In higher tax brackets, Traditional accounts might be more beneficial, allowing for tax-deferred growth and lower tax obligations on contributions.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:** Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account, which should cover 3-6 months' worth of expenses, before significantly investing in your 401(k), IRA, or taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to align with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, a certified financial planner can provide personalized recommendations to optimize your portfolio based on your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so it's crucial to evaluate your financial goals and adjust your contributions accordingly.
