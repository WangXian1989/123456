First off, you've got to show up where they hang outâ€”so if you're still thinking Facebook is the place, you're already behind the times. Dive into TikTok and Instagram because that's where the party's at! Create viral content thatâ€™s funny, relatable, or downright outrageous! Memes, challenges, whateverâ€”itâ€™s all about grabbing their attention and making them laugh (or think).

But hey, donâ€™t just throw out generic political slogans. Actually, address the issues that matter to them, like student debt, climate change, and social justice. Make them feel like their voice counts and that youâ€™re genuinely listening. And hereâ€™s the kicker: team up with influencers that resonate with young folks. If they're rocking the latest trends, theyâ€™ve got the golden ticket to your campaign. Engaging campaigns that feel more like a conversation than a lecture will get them involved!
