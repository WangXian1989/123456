The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are also tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties (unlike 401(k) and IRA withdrawals) and can be useful for short-term goals. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts. This means balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be strategic about where to hold certain investments. For example, it may be wise to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or 401(k) due to their taxed interest income.

7. **Age Considerations:** As you get closer to retirement, you might shift toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Regularly review your investment allocations and make adjustments as needed based on your changing financial situation or market conditions. 

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your goals and risk profile.

Remember, every individual's situation is unique, so tailor these strategies to fit your specific circumstances!
