Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Aim to max out your 401(k) if possible. For 2024, it's $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Roth and Traditional**: Consider your current vs. future tax rates. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - **Max Contribution**: Try to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 in 2024).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use this for investments that may have lower tax liabilities (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).
   - **Keep a Cash Reserve**: Maintain liquidity for short-term goals or emergencies.

### General Tips:
- **Start with Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus first on 401(k) and IRA due to their tax benefits.
- **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Regularly Rebalance**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired balance.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
