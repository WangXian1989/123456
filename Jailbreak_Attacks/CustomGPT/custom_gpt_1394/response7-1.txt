Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This account can provide tax benefits depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

### Strategy Overview:

- **Short-Term Needs**: Taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Mid-Term Goals**: Consider a mix, but prioritize accounts with tax benefits.
- **Long-Term Retirement**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first.

### Tax Considerations:

- **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account as you approach retirement.
- **Investment Type**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and actively managed or higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Review:

Regularly assess your investment performance and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial goals or market conditions.
