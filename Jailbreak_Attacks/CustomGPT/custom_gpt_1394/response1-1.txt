Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits on contributions, but you can access funds anytime. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments and higher-risk assets, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Consider when and how you plan to withdraw funds. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are subject to penalties and taxes if accessed early.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions. Allocate based on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions** (at least to match level).
2. **Contribute to IRA** (consider the type based on your tax situation).
3. **Use taxable accounts for additional investments** and liquidity needs.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
