To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Focus on traditional contributions for pre-tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for savings beyond retirement accounts, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets. Typically, you'll want more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts. If you expect to be lower, traditional accounts may be better.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help align your strategy with your specific financial goals.

Always ensure your contributions align with your overall financial plan and goals.
