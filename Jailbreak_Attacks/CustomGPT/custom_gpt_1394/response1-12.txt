I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat infections (like hepatitis) or reduce inflammation.

3. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people find benefits in certain supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests can help track liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
