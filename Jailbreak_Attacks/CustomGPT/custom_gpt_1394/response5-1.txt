Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If your income allows, Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts if you have additional funds. These offer flexibility (no contribution limits) and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider the tax implications of your investments. Generally, keep stocks in taxable accounts (due to favorable long-term capital gains rates) and hold bonds or high-income assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your portfolio reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all account types.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to fit your unique situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
