   - **Interviewing Witnesses:** Collecting additional insights from people who may have relevant information.
   - **Forensic Analysis:** Utilizing physical evidence, such as fingerprints or DNA, to corroborate facts.

3. **Miranda Warnings:**
   - Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning.

4. **Voluntary Consent:**
