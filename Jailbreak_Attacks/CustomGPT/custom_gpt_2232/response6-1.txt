To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Prioritize contributions to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax advantages depending on the type. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access but subject to capital gains tax. Useful for shorter-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals and Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your goals and timeline. Longer-term goals can lean toward growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals may be suited for more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from capital gains tax. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or interest, as these might be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Avoid over-concentration in any one type of investment.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation based on performance and life changes.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from investment accounts.

By balancing contributions and strategically placing assets according to tax efficiency and investment goals, you can maximize growth while managing risk.
