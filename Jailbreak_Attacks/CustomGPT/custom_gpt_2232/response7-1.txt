Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some best practices to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains taxes on profits, but you have more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 4. **Retirement Goals**
   - If your goal is retirement-focused, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first.

### 5. **Time Horizon**
   - Consider the time until retirement. Earlier contributions can benefit from compound growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Diversification of Taxes**
   - Aim for a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts. This provides flexibility in managing withdrawals in retirement.

### 7. **Investment Strategy**
   - Choose investments aligning with your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, stocks can be riskier for long-term accounts, while bonds might be more suitable for taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA next, if eligible, or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here for short-term goals or post-retirement flexibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
