I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options often vary depending on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation.
