To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income, Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold **bonds** and **high-yield investments** in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income.
   - Place **stocks** or **growth investments** in taxable accounts, as they benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes in each account to balance risk and returns according to your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting as necessary based on market performance and your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion of your taxable accounts liquid for unexpected expenses before fully funding retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, ensuring a personalized approach.

Following these steps can help you maximize your investments' growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
