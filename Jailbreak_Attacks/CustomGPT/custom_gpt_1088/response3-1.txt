Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you construct a strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize the match, then consider contributing to your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA/ Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and eligibility, prioritize these accounts for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs might provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should be funded after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Capital gains taxes can affect your overall returns, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - Assess your investment goals. For long-term growth, prioritize equity investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term needs, consider keeping those funds in taxable accounts with safer investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, especially if you have significant market fluctuations.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions:** Max out contributions (if eligible).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use excess funds for additional investments here.
