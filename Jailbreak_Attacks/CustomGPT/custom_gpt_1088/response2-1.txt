When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k):**
   - After maxing out the match and contributing to an IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if feasible.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals:**
   - If you have savings goals that are less than 5-10 years away (e.g., a down payment on a house), consider putting money into a taxable account. This way, you aren’t penalized for early withdrawals like in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds and ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset some capital gains.

### 6. **Diversify Among Asset Classes:**
   - Ensure your investments are diverse across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), regardless of the account type. This reduces risk and increases the potential for stable returns.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Reassess your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, making adjustments as necessary.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
1. **401(k):** Max out the employer match first.
2. **IRA:** Contribute next (consider tax implications).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use for shorter-term needs and ensure tax efficiency.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
