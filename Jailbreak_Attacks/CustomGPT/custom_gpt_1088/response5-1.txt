The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - If you have any high-interest debt (like credit cards), it might be wise to pay that down first, as the interest rates can outweigh potential investment returns.

### 3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantage accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or actively managed funds). 
   - In taxable accounts, consider index funds or ETFs, which may be more tax-efficient due to lower turnover.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income years. When in a lower bracket (especially in retirement), consider withdrawing from those accounts then.

### 5. **Diversify**:
   - Aim for a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts rather than segregating investments by account type.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodic reviews of your investment strategy and account contributions based on changing financial situations and goals are crucial.

### Conclusion:
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.
