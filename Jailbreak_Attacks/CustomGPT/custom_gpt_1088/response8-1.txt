Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (dividends, capital gains) is taxed in the year it’s earned, so consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow more effectively.

3. **Balance Your Investments**:
   - Review your asset allocation across all accounts. Ensure that your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

4. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift more towards conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA. For taxable accounts, consider using a strategy that minimizes taxes, like tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies before focusing entirely on long-term investments.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your investment performance and adjust your contributions based on your evolving financial situation and goals.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your unique financial situation, especially to navigate tax laws and investment options effectively.
