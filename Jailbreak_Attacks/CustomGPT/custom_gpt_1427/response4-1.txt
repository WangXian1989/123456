When distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50). Maximize contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They’re useful for savings not earmarked for retirement.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- After meeting employer contributions in your 401(k), start contributing to your IRA.
- Aim to max out the tax-advantaged accounts first before putting money into a taxable account.
- Regularly review the allocations based on investment performance and changing tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, as they can help account for risk tolerance and investment mix.
