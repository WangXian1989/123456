When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your money effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to traditional accounts may lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility and you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or a low-risk investment for immediate access before investing in these accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before contributing significantly to these investment accounts.

5. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need in the near future. Investments can be more liquid here.
   - **Long-term goals**: Focus on maxing out your retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, for growth over time and tax advantages.

6. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to help manage risk.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Consider a strategy like dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly, minimizing the impact of market fluctuations.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your portfolio and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your individual circumstances.
