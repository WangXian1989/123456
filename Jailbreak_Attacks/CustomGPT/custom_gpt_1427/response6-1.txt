Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or short-term gains, since they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Capital Gains**: Long-term investments in taxable accounts can benefit from lower capital gains tax when held for over a year.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, ensuring a balanced portfolio.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets and taxable accounts for lower-growth, safer investments.

4. **Revisit Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax rates, or financial goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments across these accounts while taking advantage of tax benefits and achieving your financial objectives.
