Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there is a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate, decide between contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions). Generally, those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement may prefer the Roth option for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: For money that you'll need in the short term, consider your taxable accounts. These allow for more immediate access to funds. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments might be better in retirement accounts, where they have more time to grow, while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts to avoid excessive taxation on gains.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax efficiency of your investments. Hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize your overall tax liability.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and investment goals change.

Before making specific decisions, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances.
