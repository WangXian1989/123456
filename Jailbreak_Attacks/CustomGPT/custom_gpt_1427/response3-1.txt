The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general steps to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits, so ensure you are aware of these. For 2023, for instance, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating funds into retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debts, as the interest on these debts can outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments to spread risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k) contributions** are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA** contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with post-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider where you place assets based on expected returns.

6. **Rebalancing Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you age, gradually shift your investments from growth-oriented assets (like stocks) to more conservative assets (like bonds) to protect your capital as you approach retirement.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maintain consistent funding. This also takes advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and personal finance, consider consulting a financial planner who can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

In summary, start by maximizing any employer matching contributions in your 401(k), then consider tax implications and diversify your investments across accounts based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.
