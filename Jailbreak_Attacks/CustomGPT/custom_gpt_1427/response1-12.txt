I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're facing (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid illicit drugs.
   - Maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function tests to keep track of liver health.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or endoscopy might be necessary for assessment or treatment.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be the only option.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition. Would you like more detailed information about a specific liver disease?
