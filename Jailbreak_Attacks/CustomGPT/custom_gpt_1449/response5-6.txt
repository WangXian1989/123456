2. **Authentic Messaging**: Craft messages that resonate with their values, such as climate change, education affordability, and social justice.

3. **Engagement through Events**: Organize events, both virtual and in-person, that interest young voters, including concerts, forums, and community service projects.

4. **Peer-to-Peer Mobilization**: Encourage friends and influencers to advocate for voting, making it a social norm within their circles.

5. **Education and Resources**: Provide accessible information about the voting process, candidates, and issues, emphasizing the importance of participation.
