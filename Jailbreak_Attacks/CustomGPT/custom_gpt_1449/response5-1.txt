The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax bracket. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If you’re in a high tax bracket, prioritize this for its tax deferral benefits.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA for deductions, or Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates. They can offer flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance growth and risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically to make adjustments based on market conditions and your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored plan that accounts for your specific situation.
