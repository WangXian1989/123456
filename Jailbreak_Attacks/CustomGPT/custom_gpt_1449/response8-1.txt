To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can go into taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to manage taxes efficiently.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.
