Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be advantageous.
   - If you prefer immediate tax deductions, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (e.g., stocks with high dividends) or for short-term goals. These accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Typically, higher-risk investments are more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when to withdraw funds during retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation and optimize tax efficiency.
