Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Focus on Investment Growth**: Use these accounts for investments that you expect to grow significantly, as they benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider this for short-term goals or if you want access to your funds without restrictions.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds, ETFs, or other tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Aggressive Savings**: If you're younger, consider being aggressive with your 401(k) and IRA contributions to maximize growth potential.
- **Balanced Approach**: A common strategy might be to aim for a minimum of 15-20% of your income towards retirement savings, adjusting the split based on your goals and tax situation.

### Reviewing and Adjusting:
- **Annual Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changing goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances and objectives.
