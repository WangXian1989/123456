To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider placing more stable, income-generating assets here since distributions will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can choose pre-tax or post-tax contributions. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable for growth assets like stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This could include individual stocks or index funds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as needed to maintain your target investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement to optimize your tax situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
