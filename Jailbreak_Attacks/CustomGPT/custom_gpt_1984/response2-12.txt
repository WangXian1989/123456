To effectively address liver problems, it's crucial to work with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.
   - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess progress.
   - Imaging studies (like ultrasounds) to evaluate organ health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases (e.g., liver tumors or cirrhosis), surgical procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Certain vitamins or herbs may support liver health, but consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
