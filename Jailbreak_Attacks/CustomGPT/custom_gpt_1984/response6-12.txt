1. **Medication:**
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
   - Medications to manage symptoms and complications.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Avoiding alcohol.
   - Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Monitoring and Support:**
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider.
   - Screening for liver cancer if at risk.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.
