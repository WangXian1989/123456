Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as it's essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds and REITs) to defer taxes. 
   - Keep investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider different investment types and asset classes.

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings in your taxable account for emergencies. Retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Long-Term Strategy:**
   - Regularly reassess and rebalance your investments to adapt to changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider discussing your strategy with a financial adviser to tailor a plan that suits your individual needs.

By following these principles, you can effectively manage your distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
