To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments within taxable accounts do not have tax advantages; you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. Consider time horizon and risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Timing**:
   - Funds in retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal before age 59Â½. Ensure you're not planning to access these funds soon.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k)** contributions, especially to get the full employer match.
- **Fund an IRA** next, favoring a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to your **taxable accounts** for additional flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions, particularly if there's matching.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, using Roth if eligible.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can go here for flexibility and liquidity.
