For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - For specific conditions (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and condition progression.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver resection or transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may consider herbal supplements, but consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan based on your specific condition.
