To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages of IRAs:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you're looking for a tax deduction or a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. These accounts also allow for capital gains tax on profits, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - **Tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs):** Keep these in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to defer taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds):** Place these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

7. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while minimizing taxes over time. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
