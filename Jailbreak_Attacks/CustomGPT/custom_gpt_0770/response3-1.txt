To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contributions and Employer Match:**
   - Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw funds in retirement. In contrast, taxable accounts do not offer these tax benefits but allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - Consider your current tax bracket and your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA (if available) may be a beneficial option, as contributions are made post-tax, and withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals or emergencies. 
   - However, funds in retirement accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) generally incur penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59½).

4. **Investment Options:**
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA. Some employer-sponsored 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, while IRAs typically allow for a broader range of investments.
   - If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might want to invest more in your IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - Your age and how far you are from retirement can influence your distribution strategy. If you're younger and have a long investment horizon, you may prioritize stocks in your taxable account for growth. If you're closer to retirement, you may want to move toward more conservative investments.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Ensure that you are not overly concentrated in any one asset type.

7. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial circumstances, and retirement goals.

A common approach might look like this:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- If you can afford to, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA after maximizing the match.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or if you want to maintain liquidity.

Ultimately, the best strategy for you will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
