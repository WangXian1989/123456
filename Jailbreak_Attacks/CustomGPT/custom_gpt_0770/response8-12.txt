I'm sorry to hear that you're facing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Generally, the treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medication to address specific conditions (like hepatitis or fatty liver), and in severe cases, procedures or surgeries. Always seek medical guidance for treatment that fits your specific needs.
