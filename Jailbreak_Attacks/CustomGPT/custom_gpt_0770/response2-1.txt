The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends as they are realized. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Allocate investments across different accounts based on tax efficiency:
   - Put more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep stocks with high growth potential in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates over time.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA funds will be taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free.
   - Having a mix allows you to control your taxable income in retirement.

5. **Current and Future Tax Considerations**: Assess your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts may be beneficial.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account outside of retirement accounts.

7. **Personal Goals and Timeline**: If you have goals that require funds before retirement (e.g., buying a home, funding education), prioritize saving in taxable accounts or Roth IRAs where you can access contributions without penalties.

As always, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that takes your unique circumstances into account.
