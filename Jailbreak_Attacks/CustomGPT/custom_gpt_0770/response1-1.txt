The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance between Accounts:**
   - Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (if possible), allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts. This can be useful for more flexible access to your money before retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Distributions from 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals. Understanding your current and projected future tax rates can help inform your decisions.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Regardless of which account you're contributing to, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as your needs and market conditions change. 

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Finally, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By considering these points, you can better distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work towards your financial goals.
