The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these retirement accounts are often made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional accounts can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you won’t get tax deductions, capital gains and dividends are taxed at lower rates, which can be beneficial if held for the long term.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

4. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before making significant contributions, ensure that any high-interest debt is managed, as the interest rates on such debt can often exceed investment returns.

5. **Retirement Goals**: If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions, as these funds are specifically designed for retirement savings.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Consider setting up automatic contributions to each account type to maintain a consistent savings routine.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations, contributions, and financial goals to adjust your strategy as needed.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help create a personalized distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation.
