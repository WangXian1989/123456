When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement, potentially at a lower tax rate.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits and income taxes on interest or dividends. Use these accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Keep sufficient cash in a savings account for emergencies rather than heavily investing in retirement accounts, which may incur penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Long-Term Considerations**: If you are far from retirement, favor tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) that allow your investments to grow without immediate taxation. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards a mix that may include more taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
