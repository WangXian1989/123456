To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially 'free money'.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've optimized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional savings into taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for accessing funds prior to retirement without penalties.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) or to maintain liquidity for future expenses.

3. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your overall portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals, distributing assets among stocks, bonds, and cash in each type of account. 

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be aware of the tax implications for each account type. Interest from bonds or dividends from stocks in taxable accounts can incur taxes, while growth in IRAs and 401(k)s can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and understanding the flexibility you gain with taxable accounts, you can effectively manage your investment strategy across all account types.
