When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into your IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: This may provide a pre-tax contribution option, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out (up to $22,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Before making investments, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses. This should be in a high-yield savings account, separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider whether to invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, long-term growth investments (like stocks) are placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns and long-term capital gains treatment.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the performance of investments will alter your asset allocation. Rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your target allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary widely. Getting a tailored strategy from a professional can help ensure your decisions align with your financial goals.

Always ensure you take into account your personal financial situation, goals, and any tax implications.
