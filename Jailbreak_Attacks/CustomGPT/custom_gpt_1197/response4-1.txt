Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when you sell assets for a profit, and you'll pay taxes on any dividends or interest earned annually.

3. **Diversity in Investment Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often includes a range of mutual funds or ETFs. Choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: You can often have a broader selection of investment types, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Consider using this for longer-term growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Most suitable for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner. Tax-efficient funds or investments (like index funds) can help minimize tax impacts.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is many years away, you may want to take a more aggressive approach with your investments (higher percentage in stocks). As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing. It’s generally recommended to keep 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a liquid, accessible account.

6. **Regular Reviews and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to ensure it aligns with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the "best" way to distribute your money hinges on your specific circumstances, so it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to help create a personalized plan.
