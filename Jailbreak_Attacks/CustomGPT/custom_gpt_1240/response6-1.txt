Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider for optimal allocation:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on tax implications) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Hold Tax-Intensive Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place high-growth investments like stocks or real estate in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts, minimizing capital gains taxes when trading.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Focus**: If you have a longer time horizon, align your investments with growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts while preserving some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and market outlook, ensuring a balanced portfolio that suits your financial objectives.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess**
   - **Review Allocation Periodically**: As your financial situation changes (income, job status, market conditions), adjust your contributions among accounts accordingly.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risks.

### Summary:
- **Maximize tax-advantaged contributions (401(k) and IRA)** before funding taxable accounts.
- **Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts** to minimize tax burdens.
- **Regularly review and adjust allocations** to align with financial goals and market dynamics.
