Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts in an optimal way depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match first, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider how the investment options and fees compare to your other accounts.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contributing to a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after you've taken advantage of your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you may need before retirement or for specific short-term goals. Invest after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**: 

- Start by maximizing the match in your 401(k).
- Next, aim to put money into a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- Use a taxable account for additional savings and investment flexibility, particularly if you are saving for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing the money before retirement age.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation, especially considering factors like tax implications and your retirement timeline.
