Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Keep in mind that distributions will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. Keep track of contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Interest and capital gains are taxed, but you have more flexibility in withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Each account can hold different types of investments based on your strategy.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you're investing for the long term (20 years or more), factor that into your asset allocation. Later-life allocations may lean more toward conservative investments as you approach retirement.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds. In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your situation may change over time, so review your investment distribution regularly and adjust based on your evolving goals and market conditions.

It might also be wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
