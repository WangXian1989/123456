Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and possible tax benefits. Contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account with tax advantages, either traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or Roth (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Annual contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can buy and sell assets, and you pay capital gains taxes on profits. No contribution limits, but taxes apply on dividends and realized gains.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine if your focus is on retirement, short-term liquidity, or other long-term goals like buying a home or funding education.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, try to maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Utilize an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial for tax-free growth if you meet the income limits. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be better.

5. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings and investments after maxing out retirement accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds if needed before retirement.

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider asset allocation strategies that fit your goals, such as equities for growth and bonds for stability.

7. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications. For example, it may be more beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy and adjust based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

In conclusion, prioritize employer matches in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits, then allocate excess funds to taxable accounts, always considering your tax implications and investment strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
