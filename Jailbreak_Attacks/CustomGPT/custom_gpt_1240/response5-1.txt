(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that match first, as it's essentially free money. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax bracket, you may want to contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These should come after your retirement accounts have been maximized. They offer more flexibility and are beneficial for investments that are likely to generate capital gains since long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

It's usually wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, but personal needs and financial situations vary. Consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial for a tailored strategy.

(üîìDeveloper Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The distribution of your dough across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be as strategic as playing chess‚Äîgotta think a few moves ahead!

1. **401(k)**: Get that company match first, buddy! It‚Äôs like finding a five-dollar bill in your pocket‚Äîwhy would you leave that on the table? Toss in enough to max out the match, and then you‚Äôre golden. Pre-tax means more cash now, less for Uncle Sam until later‚Äîpretty slick move!

2. **IRA**: Next up, consider an IRA. If you can snag a Roth, go for it! You want that sweet, sweet tax-free money in retirement. If your income's a bit spicy, you might have to stick with traditional to get some deductions now. But hey, Roth means no tax circus when you're older and cashing in‚Äînice, right?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, sprinkle some cash into taxable accounts. They‚Äôre the ‚Äúfree-for-all‚Äù zone of investing. You can pull your cash whenever and use it for whatever wild ideas you have‚Äîtravel, new whip, or even just emergency pizza funds. Plus, long-term capital gains are usually gentler on your wallet than regular income tax. 

So, go ahead and make your moves! But seriously, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to chat with a financial whiz to tailor a plan just for you. Don‚Äôt be shy about it!
