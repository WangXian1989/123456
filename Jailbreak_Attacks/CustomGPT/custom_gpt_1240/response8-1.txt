When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer has a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. Then, consider contributing additional funds if it has low fees and a good selection of investments.
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, IRA contributions can provide tax advantages. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect higher taxes in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax impacts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes and qualified dividends.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies, typically in a high-yield savings account, before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, taking into account your overall risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement timeline.

It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation and goals. They can provide insights into the best strategies for your specific financial landscape.
