Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. This may allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on which type of account you choose.
   - Consider how employer matches work in your 401(k). If available, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider investing in an IRA (Individual Retirement Account).
   - Depending on your circumstances, you may opt for a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and easy access for short-term goals. You might also use these for investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account type. Consider risk tolerance: higher-risk assets might be better suited for accounts that benefit from long-term growth, while more stable options might be appropriate for funds that may be needed sooner.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will access your funds. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage tax liabilities in retirement.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

Before making any decisions, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
