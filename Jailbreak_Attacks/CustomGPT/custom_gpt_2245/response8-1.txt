The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, and your tax situation. Here are some general guidelines on how to allocate funds across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a good return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Consequences**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Funds in your 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Tax-Exempt Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: When investing in taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions can change. Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

In summary, a suggested order of priority might be: first, maximize your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider funding an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts as needed, keeping in mind the tax implications and the overall investment strategy.
