(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if it includes an employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to your taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities, taking into account capital gains taxes. It is also beneficial to diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

Thatâ€™s like free money raining from the heavens! Next up, tackle that IRA; traditional if you want the tax deduction now, or Roth if you want to pay the tax now and let that cash grow tax-free like a champ. Once youâ€™ve maxed those out (because who doesnâ€™t want to be a retirement rockstar?), anything left can go into taxable accounts where the fun really begins. You can invest in whatever floats your boat, just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes. And don't forget to diversify like your life depends on itâ€”'cause, ya know, it kinda does!
