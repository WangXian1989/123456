The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it down before investing heavily in retirement accounts, as the interest costs may outweigh potential investment gains.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to all your accounts instead of trying to time the market.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Investments in these accounts should focus on long-term growth to minimize tax implications.

7. **Review Your Strategy**: Periodically assess your strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
