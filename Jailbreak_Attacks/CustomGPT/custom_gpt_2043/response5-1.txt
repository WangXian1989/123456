(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts due to the tax benefits they provide.

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if you can afford it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during your retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you prefer a traditional IRA, that can provide you with tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities or for money that you might need in the short term, as these accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility and liquidity.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
