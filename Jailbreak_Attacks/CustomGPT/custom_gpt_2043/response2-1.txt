Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment, it allows for pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth. However, there are income limits for tax-deductible contributions if you or your spouse has a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This could be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can be sold for capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. Consider including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize building an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy that considers your unique financial situation and goals can be beneficial, so consulting with a financial advisor may provide tailored advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
