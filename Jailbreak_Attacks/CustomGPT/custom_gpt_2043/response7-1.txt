Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This allows you to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Here, you can invest in anything from stocks and bonds to mutual funds and ETFs.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and optimize returns based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Regular Reassessment:** Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
