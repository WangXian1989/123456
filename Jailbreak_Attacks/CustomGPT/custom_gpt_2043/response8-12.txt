I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary significantly depending on the specific liver condition you're facing. Generally, options may include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, alcohol cessation, regular exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, surgical interventions or liver transplant. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider for a personalized approach tailored to your situation.
