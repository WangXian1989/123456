Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify, as these accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Keep in mind the tax treatment of each account type: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Use your taxable accounts for short-term investment goals or as a buffer for emergencies, since they offer flexibility without the penalties associated with retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes to balance risk and return.
   - Some investors prefer higher-risk investments within taxable accounts to take advantage of capital gains tax rates, while holding safer investments in tax-deferred accounts.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth while effectively managing your tax exposure. Always revisit your strategy periodically to align with changes in financial goals or market conditions.
