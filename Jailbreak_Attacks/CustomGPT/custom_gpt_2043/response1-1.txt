Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Focus on tax-deferred growth and consider the available investment options. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy. A traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. 

A balanced approach could involve maxing out your 401(k) contributions to benefit from employer matching, then contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages, and finally investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.
