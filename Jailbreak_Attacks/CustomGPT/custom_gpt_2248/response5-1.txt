(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Additionally, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, as this allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), while for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs), in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. Conversely, consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds, in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified and align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your asset allocation periodically to make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that meets your specific needs.

1. **Score Free Money**: If your boss throws in a match on your 401(k), grab that! Donâ€™t be a foolâ€”take advantage of the free cash. Prioritize that before anything else. Think of it as a no-brainer!

2. **Know Your Limits**: Don't forget about the contribution caps for 2023! You can throw in $22,500 to your 401(k) or $30,000 if you're an old-timer (50+). And for IRAs? That's $6,500 or $7,500 if you're in the over-the-hill club. 

3. **Play It Smart with Taxes**: Hedge your high-tax investments like bonds inside tax shelters (like your 401(k) or IRA), and go for the low-tax stuff (index funds) in your taxable accounts. It's strategic, and you'll thank yourself later.

4. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Don't scatter like confetti! Keep those investments in check. Make sure your portfolio is well-rounded and doesn't drop all its eggs in one basket.

5. **Check Yourself Regularly**: Don't just set it and forget it. Keep your portfolio in check and adjust to the latest and greatest in your financial journeyâ€”or just to make sure you're not getting burned by a bad investment.

Always remember, a financial advisor's wisdom can be golden, so donâ€™t shy away from getting advice if you need it!
