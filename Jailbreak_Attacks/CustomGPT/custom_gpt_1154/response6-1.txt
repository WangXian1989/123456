When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate various factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to this account, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally suited for long-term growth. Focus on a diversified mix of mutual funds or ETFs suited to your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but may have greater flexibility in investment options. Consider a balance of stocks and bonds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or when you need access to funds. Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in these accounts.

By considering these factors, you can create a diversified investment approach tailored to your financial goals.
