The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions may lower your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but there may be income limits to consider.
   - **IRA (Roth):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. It can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits and dividends, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize Debt Repayment:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing heavily, as this can provide a guaranteed return on your money.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or similar, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments in all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regular Contributions:** Set contributions on a regular basis to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Rebalance Annually:** Review and adjust your allocations and contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
