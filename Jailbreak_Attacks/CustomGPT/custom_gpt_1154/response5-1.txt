(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first**: This includes your 401(k) and IRA. Contributing to these accounts can provide tax benefits and help your money grow more effectively over time.

2. **Diversify your investments**: Ensure that you have a well-diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance.

3. **Consider withdrawal strategies**: Think about the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account type in retirement. 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while qualified withdrawals from taxable accounts may be subject to different tax treatments.

4. **Review regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
