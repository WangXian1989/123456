The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating significant resources to retirement accounts, make sure to pay down any high-interest debt, as it often has a higher cost than potential investment returns.

3. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals will be taxed later. In contrast, Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in each account. If your 401(k) has limited investment choices or higher fees, you might prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts instead.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in each type of account are well-diversified to manage risk.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid, taxable account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

8. **Lifecycle Planning**: Adjust your contributions based on your life stageâ€”earlier in your career, you might prioritize a 401(k), while closer to retirement, you might shift focus toward IRAs or taxable accounts to enhance liquidity.

9. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored strategy based on your unique situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

Always consider your current and future tax situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance when making these decisions.
