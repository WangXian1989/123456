Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and preference). These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your money grow.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) after your IRA, focusing on maximizing contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after contributing to your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This may be particularly useful if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Tax implications are critical; tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs and some taxable accounts may offer tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across each account type.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Remember, maintaining a balanced approach to investing while considering both your short-term and long-term financial goals is essential.
