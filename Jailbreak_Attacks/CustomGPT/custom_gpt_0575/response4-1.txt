Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. For a traditional account, contributions are often tax-deductible, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before maxing out retirement accounts. Pay off high-interest debts that could cost more than potential investment gains.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If income limits apply, explore backdoor Roth IRA options.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the near term or for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Stocks for growth can go in tax-deferred accounts, while bonds or income-producing assets can be placed in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your distribution and adjust based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
