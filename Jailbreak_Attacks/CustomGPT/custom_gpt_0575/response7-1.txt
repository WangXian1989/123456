Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured way to think about it:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Some employers match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages similar to a 401(k), but you control it. You can choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) types.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts with no tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime without penalty. Pay capital gains taxes on any earnings when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is a guaranteed return.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to your IRA. Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** After securing the IRA contribution, maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** These accounts grow tax-free until withdrawal, making them ideal for higher yielding investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments with lower turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations, especially as you approach retirement. Adjust as necessary based on changes to your financial situation or goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income until max is reached, then decrease if needed.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest what's left after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Key Takeaways:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Be mindful of tax implications for each type of account.
- Diversify investments based on your goals and risk tolerance.
