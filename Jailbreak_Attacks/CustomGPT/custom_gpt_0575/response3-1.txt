Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to guide your allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account that allows tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA) in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have the same tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA (if eligible) next. The lower your current tax rate, the more beneficial a Traditional IRA may be; conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.

### 4. **Allocate Remaining Funds**
   - After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, consider allocating any remaining funds to your taxable accounts. This allows for greater liquidity and flexibility, though be mindful of the tax implications.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to risk tolerance and retirement timeline. In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs that generate lower taxable distributions.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reevaluate your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on performance, tax law changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - For personalized guidance, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

By systematically distributing your funds across these accounts while considering tax implications and investment opportunities, you can optimize your retirement savings effectively.
