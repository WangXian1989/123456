1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage liver conditions.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continued follow-up with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and make adjustments to your treatment plan as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, procedures or surgery may be required, such as liver transplantation.

5. **Supplements**: Some may find benefits from liver health supplements, but you should discuss these with your doctor.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your health situation.
