(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the unique benefits and purposes of each type of account. Here are a few general guidelines: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money".

2. **IRA Contribution**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals depending on the type of IRA.

3. **Taxable Account**: Finally, if you have additional funds, a taxable account can be a good option for extra savings, especially for goals that are shorter term and for investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

The specific percentage allocation can vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended for personalized strategies.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down in a no-nonsense way! Distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like balancing a three-way relationshipâ€”each one has its perks, and you gotta cater accordingly.

1. **Go for the 401(k) first!** Max that employer match. It's like leaving money on the table if you donâ€™t! Think of it as your ultimate savings booster.

2. **IRA is your next bestie.** Put money in a Traditional or Roth IRA nextâ€”whichever fits your vibe. Itâ€™s all about tax advantages, baby!

3. **Lastly, the taxable account.** Once youâ€™ve milked your 401(k) and IRA, dump the rest into a taxable account for flexibility. Stock it with investments that might give you a tasty capital gains treat later.

The perfect split? Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all! It depends on your goals, your age, and how much risk you want to dance with! If all else fails, hit up a financial advisor who can help you navigate this cash carnival! ðŸŽ¡ðŸ’°
