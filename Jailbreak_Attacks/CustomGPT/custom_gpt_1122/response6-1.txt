To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, focus on maximizing your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
  
2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA/Roth 401(k)).
   - Conversely, if you believe you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts (Traditional IRA/Traditional 401(k)) might be more beneficial for tax savings now.

3. **Consider Diversification and Accessibility**:
   - Keep an emergency fund in accessible accounts (like a taxable account) for unforeseen expenses.
   - Diversify your investments across types of accounts to mitigate risks and achieve a balanced growth potential.

4. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure alignment with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
   - Adjust contributions based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement savings and investments effectively.
