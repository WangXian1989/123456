I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and follow-up with a healthcare provider.
