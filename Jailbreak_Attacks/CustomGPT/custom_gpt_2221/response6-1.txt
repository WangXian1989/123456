Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money!
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets that are taxed as ordinary income.
     - Focus on long-term growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like ETFs and index funds).
     - Favor long-term capital gains treatment by holding investments for over a year.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**
   - Short-term needs may require more liquidity, favoring taxable accounts.
   - Long-term growth strategies can focus on 401(k) and IRA options.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. It might influence whether to withdraw from traditional or Roth accounts strategically.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (to max out employer match)
- **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** $6,500 annually (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments

### Conclusion
Tailor these guidelines to your personal situation, and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
