I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol, high-fat foods, and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Stay away from substances harmful to the liver, such as certain medications, alcohol, and recreational drugs.

5. **Natural Remedies**:
   - Some herbs, like milk thistle, may support liver health, but always consult with a doctor before trying new supplements.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgery might be necessary, such as for tumors or severe cirrhosis.

For accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment, please see a healthcare provider.
