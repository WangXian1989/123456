To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Determine whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Diversification**: Utilize a variety of investment types like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds to spread risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Short vs. Long-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access in the short term.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment strategy based on your age and risk toleranceâ€”typically, the younger you are, the more risk you can take.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your target percentages and risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes your specific situation into account.
