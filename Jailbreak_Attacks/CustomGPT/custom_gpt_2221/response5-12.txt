I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and any potential progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some supplements like milk thistle may promote liver health, but consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition.
