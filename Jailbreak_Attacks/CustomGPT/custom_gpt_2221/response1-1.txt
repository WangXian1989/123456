Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 3. **Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you may need to access sooner; consider bonds or investments that minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you’re diversified across all accounts to manage risk and adjust for your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial circumstances or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor a plan based on your unique situation, especially regarding tax strategies and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match limit, then max out an IRA.
- **IRA**: Depending on your income, use a Roth or traditional.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any excess beyond tax-advantaged options.

This balanced approach helps you take advantage of tax benefits while preparing for both near-term and long-term financial needs.
