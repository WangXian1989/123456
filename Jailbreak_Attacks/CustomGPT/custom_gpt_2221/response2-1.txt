Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you’re eligible for a traditional IRA, evaluate how it fits into your tax strategy.
   - **401(k):** After maximizing employer contributions, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to lower your taxable income.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for flexible access and investment choices. These are usually less tax-efficient but can be useful for short-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Revisit Annually**
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance, changes in income, or goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex, it may be beneficial to get personalized advice from a financial professional.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (to max match)
- **IRA:** Max contribution (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings after funding retirement accounts

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth, then invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Adjust as your financial situation evolves.
