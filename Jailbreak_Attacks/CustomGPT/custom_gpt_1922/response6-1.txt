To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA if you want to reduce your taxable income now.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep investments that generate high tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Types:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and consider risk tolerance when allocating your funds.

3. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Monitor the performance of each account and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax status, and retirement goals.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan ahead for how you will withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial.

Each individualâ€™s financial situation is unique, so it may benefit you to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies. For further guidance on implementing financial strategies, consider reaching out to a financial planning service.
