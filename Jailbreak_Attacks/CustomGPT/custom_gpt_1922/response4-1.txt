When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your qualification). IRAs can offer more investment options than a 401(k) and potentially lower fees.

3. **Balance Contributions:** Assess your tax situation. Contributions to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your expected tax bracket in retirement, you might optimize contributions between these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting excess funds in a taxable account. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but be aware of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Assess Your Investment Strategy:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversifying your investments across various asset classes can help manage risk.

6. **Revisit Annually:** Your financial situation and tax laws may change, so it's a good practice to review your allocation annually and make adjustments as necessary.

For personalized tips tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide insights based on your goals and current financial landscape.
