When distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides a solid foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have a high enough salary and have reached the match, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your income level and tax situation). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, whereas a Traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions.
   
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for short-term financial goals or investing in assets that may produce qualified dividends or capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Align your investment strategy within each account type:
   - **401(k):** Focus on more aggressive investments in your younger years, gradually shifting to conservative assets as retirement approaches.
   - **IRA:** Use this account for investments that could generate high returns over the long run, such as stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold tax-efficient funds or long-term investment strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

5. **Periodic Review:** Regularly review and rebalance your assets to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.
