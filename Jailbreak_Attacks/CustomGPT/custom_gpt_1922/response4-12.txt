I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice tailored to your situation. They may recommend several treatment options depending on the specific liver issue you have, which can include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medication, or more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplant. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for guidance.
