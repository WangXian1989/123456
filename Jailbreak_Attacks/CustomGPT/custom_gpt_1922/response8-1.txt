Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider your financial future and how much you can afford to contribute to your 401(k). This account grows tax-deferred until retirement, making it a great option for long-term savings.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, maximize contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can be a particularly attractive option since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. While these accounts donâ€™t provide the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties and at any time.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each type of account. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate in taxable accounts, while ordinary income tax applies to withdrawals from your 401(k) and Traditional IRA.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. This helps minimize risk and maximize returns.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation strategy regularly based on changes in income, investment performance, and financial goals.
