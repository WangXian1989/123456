Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can help optimize your investment growth and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** These are beneficial for individuals in a higher tax bracket now, as you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement, potentially at a lower rate.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are taxed upfront and withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

### 4. **Determine Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (plus catch-up contributions for those aged 50+), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (with the same catch-up option).

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically assess your investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, or market conditions. Rebalance as needed.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals from these accounts to minimize taxes. Generally, it can be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, traditional accounts second, and Roth accounts last.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach, considering tax implications, contribution limits, and withdrawal strategies, can help you maximize your investment growth across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It's also advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
