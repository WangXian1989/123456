To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these are tax-advantaged accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income now and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if available. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50)
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50)

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - In each account, aim to have a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investing**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk exposure.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if you're uncertain about your investment strategy or tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your money distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
