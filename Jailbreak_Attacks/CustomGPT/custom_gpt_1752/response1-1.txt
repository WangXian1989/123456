To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Take advantage of the tax benefits either now (Traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on gains and dividends, so consider keeping investments that generate high capital gains here for tax efficiency.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you can select more diverse investment options since IRAs often provide a broader range of choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which can incur penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help you tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), balance contributions between your IRA and taxable accounts, and focus on tax-efficient investments. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.
