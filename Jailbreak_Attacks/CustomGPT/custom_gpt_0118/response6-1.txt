Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax rate at withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income from these accounts is taxed at your ordinary rate. Use them for investments with lower tax burdens, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (Retirement)**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) in taxable accounts and more aggressive investments (like growth stocks) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account to maximize benefits. Adjust contributions throughout the year based on bonuses or changes in income.

### Conclusion
Assess your situation annually or whenever significant life changes occur (new job, marriage, etc.) to ensure your distribution strategy remains aligned with your goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
