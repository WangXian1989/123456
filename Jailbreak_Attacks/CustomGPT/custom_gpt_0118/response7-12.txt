I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Complete abstinence from alcohol, if relevant.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For specific conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications can help manage symptoms and prevent further damage.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Specialist Consultation**: 
   - Working with a hepatologist for specialized care and treatment plans.

5. **In Severe Cases**: 
   - **Surgery**: Procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary for advanced liver disease.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
