To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions (if available) grow tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits apply. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on earnings. Prioritize long-term investments to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as needed to maintain your investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Keep separate liquid savings for emergencies to avoid early withdrawals from these accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. This can affect tax liabilities, so consider the order of withdrawals.
