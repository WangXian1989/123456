It's important to note that financial decisions regarding account allocation should consider your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Here are some general guidelines for distributing investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Efficient Strategies**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. You can consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) for income-generating investments that would be taxed heavily in a taxable account.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, this is where you might hold assets that produce capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: For accounts meant for long-term growth, riskier investments might pay off more than stable, low-return investments. If you're closer to retirement, you may want to shift to more conservative investments.

4. **Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), these can be great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, so consider putting your growth-oriented investments here.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying across different asset classes, regardless of the account type, to manage risk effectively.

Before making any decisions, it's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
