To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on typical financial principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for investments that generate taxable income. You might want to keep low-turnover investments or tax-efficient funds here to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate funds based on when youâ€™ll need the money. Long-term investments typically go into tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall allocation across all accounts is well-diversified among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Adjust for Taxes**:
   - Keep in mind the types of investments and their tax implications. For instance, high-growth stocks may be more advantageous in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to keep your desired asset allocation in line with your goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach not only helps in optimizing tax efficiency but also aligns your investments with your financial objectives.
