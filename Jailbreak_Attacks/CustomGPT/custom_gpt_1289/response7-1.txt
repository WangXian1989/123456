To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as they often provide tax advantages.
   - For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Taxable accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) since taxes won't impact your returns until withdrawal.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure on income and gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks. Balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Strategy for Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, plan withdrawals to manage your tax bracket effectively. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also ensure your strategy meets your specific needs and circumstances.
