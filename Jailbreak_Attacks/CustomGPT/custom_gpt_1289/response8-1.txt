Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you've held the account long enough.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of tax advantages.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments with lower turnover or those that benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks within tax-advantaged accounts for potential growth.
   - **Stable Income**: Bonds and fixed-income securities can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on dividends and interest.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Index funds or ETFs can minimize taxable distributions in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow for longer.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergency funds and short-term goals.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary based on market conditions and changes in personal circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then max out your IRA.
2. **IRA**: Choose between Traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Fill in gaps or invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

### Final Considerations
Consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your specific situation and goals.
