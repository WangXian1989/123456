Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **High-interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this off before contributing more to retirement accounts.

3. **Maximize IRAs**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider mixing contributions between traditional and Roth.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is particularly useful for investments you might need access to before retirement.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your targeted investment strategy.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
