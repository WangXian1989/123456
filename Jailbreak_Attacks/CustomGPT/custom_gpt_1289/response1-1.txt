Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Invest in a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain requirements.

3. **Max Out Contribution Limits**:
   - Once you’ve secured the match in your 401(k) and contributed to your IRA, focus on maxing out your contributions in these accounts if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After fully funding tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional investments. This can provide liquidity and more flexible withdrawal options.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRA distributions are tax-free.
   - In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to minimize risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
