When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include index funds or ETFs.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: For assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds), itâ€™s typically better to hold these in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you plan to access funds in the near term, prioritize taxable accounts, as they provide more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts if you can afford to leave the money invested for a longer period.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Decide on your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, growth-oriented investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their tax implications when sold.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds or use it for specific financial goals like emergencies or vacations.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution considers your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor may provide tailored insights based on your unique circumstances.
