The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help you make a strategic distribution:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - Contribute to an IRA to the extent allowed, either traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth. 
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use a taxable account for funds needed in the near future to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider placing high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, tapping taxable accounts first can be beneficial, followed by tax-deferred accounts, delaying withdrawals from Roth accounts as long as possible for tax-free growth.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max contributions up to employer match.
- **IRA:** $6,500 (2023 limit) if eligible for traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any excess funds after maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies based on your unique financial profile and goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your circumstances change.
