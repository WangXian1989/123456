The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now (with taxes owed upon withdrawal).

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit (if feasible). This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you've already maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure a well-diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This may include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio as needed, considering changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain about the best approach, seeking guidance from a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your unique situation.

Overall, the key is to take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts first, then consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Make sure to align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals.
