When planning to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next (traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you’ve maximized the tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Great for reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free—ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Remember, capital gains will be taxed, so consider this when deciding what to hold in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocation strategy periodically to adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Overall, balancing contributions based on tax advantages, employer matches, and your investment goals will help optimize your financial strategy.
