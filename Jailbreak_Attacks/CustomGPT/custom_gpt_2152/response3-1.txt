Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Pre-Tax Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Post-Tax Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategies:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact from distributions.

### 4. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Ensure that you have a separate emergency fund outside of these investment accounts before investing heavily.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and adjust for changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor strategies specific to your circumstances, especially for tax planning.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
