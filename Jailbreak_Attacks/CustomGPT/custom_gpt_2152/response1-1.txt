When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - *Taxable Accounts:* Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to reduce tax burdens.
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without tax.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to mitigate risk.

4. **Review Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Manage withdrawals and contributions with an eye on your current and expected future tax brackets.

5. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon:**
   - Align your asset allocation with your investment goals (short-term vs. long-term) while considering your age and risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
