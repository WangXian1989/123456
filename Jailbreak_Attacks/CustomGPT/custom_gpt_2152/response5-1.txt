When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Use a traditional account if you need immediate tax deductions or a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, for example, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Emergency Fund & Debt Management**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and tackle high-interest debts before maximizing contributions to investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, and aim for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, in those accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

This balanced approach helps you take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity for short- and long-term goals.
