Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Consider maxing out these accounts based on contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short- to mid-term goals (e.g., buying a home).

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (which may generate taxable events).

6. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to maintain your risk profile. Place investments that generate high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan tailored to your circumstances can provide more specific guidance.

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity based on your financial goals.
