To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options available within each account type. Here’s a comprehensive approach:

1. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if employer matching is available, as it is essentially "free money."
   - Evaluate the contribution limits for IRAs (Roth or Traditional) and ensure you take full advantage if eligible.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Utilize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for investments that generate high tax liabilities (e.g., bonds).
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate a more aggressive portfolio in your tax-deferred accounts since you won’t pay taxes on any gains until withdrawal.
   - Consider a balanced or conservative allocation in taxable accounts due to the potential for immediate tax implications.

4. **Time Horizon and Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Assess when you plan to access your funds. Longer time horizons may lean towards aggressive strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Plan tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement, ensuring you're aware of your tax bracket and the order of account withdrawals.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Balance your risk across all accounts according to your overall asset allocation strategy rather than isolating risk within each account.

By considering these factors and opting for a strategic allocation, you can effectively distribute your investments to meet your long-term financial goals while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
