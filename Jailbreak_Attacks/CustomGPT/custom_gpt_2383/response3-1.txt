Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your eligibility, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts as Needed:** Once you've hit the limits for tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts. Be aware of capital gains taxes when you sell investments in these accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Strategically think about how your income and investments will be taxed. For instance, if you're in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.

5. **Rebalance Portfolio Regularly:** Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given individual circumstances, speaking with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that considers your entire financial picture.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax implications.
