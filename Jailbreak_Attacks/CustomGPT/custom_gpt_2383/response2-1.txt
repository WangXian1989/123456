When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment options, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future income.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: Contribute to accounts with tax advantages first (401(k) and IRA). Both options allow for tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, which can significantly increase your retirement savings over time.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment returns.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. 

6. **Reassess and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. This may involve consulting with a financial advisor.

In summary, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while allowing for liquidity in taxable accounts is often the best strategy. Always tailor your investments to fit your individual financial landscape.
