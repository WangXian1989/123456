It's great that you're planning for your financial future! Here's a general strategy you might consider when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money! 

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of your employer's match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether it's a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. They offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once your IRA is maxed out (or you've contributed what you can), return to your 401(k) and continue making contributions up to the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. This gives you more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be balanced in a way that fits your financial goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Remember, personal financial situations are unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.
