The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: With a Traditional IRA, you may get a tax deduction on contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but you pay taxes on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but allow for more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Consider diversifying your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, you might want to focus on paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Think about when youâ€™ll need the funds. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since they can be accessed without penalties.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your needs and tax laws can change, so review your distribution regularly to optimize for performance and tax efficiency.

A financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.
