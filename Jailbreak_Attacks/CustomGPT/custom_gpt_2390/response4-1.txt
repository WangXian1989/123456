Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before directing funds to other accounts. It's essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax if it's a Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income now while allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRAs**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax benefits, but they offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties. Focus on lower-turnover investments to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're saving for retirement that is many years away, you may want to be more aggressive with your investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider using taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

4. **Allocate Based on Risk**: Your risk tolerance should influence where you place certain investments. More volatile investments, like stocks, may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where you can defer taxes. Consider spreading less volatile investments across all types of accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your total portfolio is diversified across all your accounts. Keep an eye on asset allocation to adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your life.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual situations can vary greatly, it might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.

7. **Regularly Review Your Accounts**: As your situation changes, so should your allocations. Regularly revisit your strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals.

In summary, a balanced approach typically involves maximizing your employer's 401(k) match, utilizing tax-advantaged accounts effectively, and considering your overall financial landscape. Planning and regular reviews are key to a successful investment strategy.
