The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Check the annual contribution limits and aim to contribute enough to get any employer match in your 401(k).

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributing to tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA, as they can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, you might also consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) within each account type to reduce risk. Keep in mind that higher risk investments typically offer higher potential returns.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Goals**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency savings fund outside of retirement accounts for short-term needs. Money that you'll need in the immediate future should be in safer investments, often in taxable accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement age, or for tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs that have lower turnover rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment distribution and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and approaching retirement.

A balanced approach tailored to your individual circumstances will help you effectively manage your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
