The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50). This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA (contributions are made with after-tax dollars) may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals, but you’ll pay capital gains tax on earnings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Often, more aggressive investments are held in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial planner can offer personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.

Ultimately, the key is to balance growth potential with tax efficiency while aligning investment choices with your retirement goals.
