(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Assess your tax situation**: Contributions to a traditional IRA and 401(k) may reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on when you intend to access the funds. Generally, long-term investments can tolerate more risk, while funds needed in the near term should be in lower-risk investments.

4. **Diversify your investments**: Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation and help you develop a personalized strategy.
