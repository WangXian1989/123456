The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s) or post-tax (for Roth 401(k)s), which can provide tax benefits in the short term or long term.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. These accounts can provide more liquidity but come with tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk. Different accounts can hold various asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about your future withdrawal strategies, as the taxation of withdrawals can vary based on the account type. Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because individual situations vary, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution plan based on your specific goals, needs, and risk tolerance.

Make sure to review your plan regularly and adjust it as needed based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals. Always consider both current and projected future tax implications when making investment decisions.
