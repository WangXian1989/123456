Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your investments and tax efficiency. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you're eligible. Roth IRA contributions can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments you might need in the short term or for assets likely to generate capital gains. Using tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) can mitigate tax liability.
   - **Dividends and Interest**: Be mindful of your investment choices for your taxable accounts to minimize high-tax issues.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Long-Term vs Short-Term**: For long-term growth, lean towards equities in tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, conservative investments in taxable accounts might be more appropriate.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategies depending on the specific account, keeping in mind that riskier investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to the tax benefits when compounding.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay informed about annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - **Life Changes**: Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation and needs.
