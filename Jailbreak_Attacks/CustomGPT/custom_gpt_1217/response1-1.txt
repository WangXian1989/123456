The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, income level, tax situation, and investment options. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which can help you save on taxes now or in the future. Consider maxing out these contributions if you're eligible, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these accounts do not offer tax advantages, they provide liquidity and flexibility. You can invest in a broad range of assets and access your funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. Typically, it's advised to save 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your investment horizon. If you are saving for retirement far in the future, you may consider a more aggressive investment strategy in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can serve different purposes (e.g., growth versus income) and may have different investment strategies to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your contributions and investment performance. You may need to adjust your strategy as your financial situation, life goals, and market conditions change.

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your specific situation.
