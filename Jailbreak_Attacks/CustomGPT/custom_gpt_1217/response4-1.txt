When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to understand the advantages and limitations of each account type. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s), reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. They provide more flexibility with withdrawals, but tax efficiency is usually lower compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. Typically, a fund covering 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

4. **Debt Management**: High-interest debt should be paid down first before making significant contributions to retirement accounts, as interest can accumulate quickly and negate investment gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Stocks may dominate in the long term for growth, while bonds can provide stability, especially in conservative allocation as you age.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., $22,500 for a 401(k) in 2023; $6,500 for an IRA). The limits can affect how you distribute your contributions.

7. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: If you believe you may need access to funds before retirement, consider keeping a portion of your investments in a taxable account. IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawals.

8. **Long-Term Strategy**: Regularly reassess your strategy as you age, considering your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your situation, ensuring optimal tax advantages and investment growth for your financial goals.
