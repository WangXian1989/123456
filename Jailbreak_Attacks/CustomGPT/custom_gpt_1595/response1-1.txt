The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement plans, and current financial situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money!
   - **Higher Limits**: 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits than IRAs, so consider maximizing your contributions here if possible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: A traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Diversify Contributions**: If eligible, you might want to contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA to diversify your tax exposure in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough cash in your taxable account for short-term needs or an emergency fund.
   - **Investment Growth**: Consider holding investments in a taxable account that have lower capital gains taxes or investments that pay qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift more toward safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining some growth in your taxable accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so it can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Remember, it's important to periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and changing financial goals.
