Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax benefits either now (traditional) or during retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment strategies.

3. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Investments**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account that covers 3-6 months of expenses. After securing this, consider using taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that may need to be liquidated quickly.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains taxes, while placing more stable investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals**: For long-term retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA. For short-term goals, focus on taxable accounts for better access to funds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as necessary based on market performance and life changes.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
