Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, maximize that first. This is essentially free money. If you're able, contribute enough to get the full match and then consider putting additional funds toward your IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you’re eligible, contributing to an IRA can offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs might help reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level and tax situation, you might prioritize contributions to one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, or if you need more liquidity (e.g., for buying a house or for emergencies), consider investing in a taxable account. While these don’t have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility as you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.

In summary, prioritize 401(k) contributions to take advantage of matching, then contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits, and finally invest in a taxable account for more immediate access to funds.
