I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or others. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, surgical procedures. A healthcare provider can give you the best guidance based on your individual health needs.
