When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement, as they allow easier access without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) for your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Your Investments**:
   - Keep bonds and interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Consider holding more aggressive, growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to enjoy favorable long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Continuously assess your investments across all accounts to ensure you maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively allocate your funds while minimizing taxes and optimizing growth.
