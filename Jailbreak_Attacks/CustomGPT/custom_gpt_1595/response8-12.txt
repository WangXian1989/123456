Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. They might recommend treatments such as lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures to manage liver health effectively. Diet adjustments, such as increasing fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight, can also help. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice!
