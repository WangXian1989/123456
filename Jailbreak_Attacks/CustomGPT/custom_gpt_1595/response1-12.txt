I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. Treatment for liver problems can vary depending on the underlying cause and severity. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, medical procedures. It's essential to get personalized advice from a qualified expert. Take care!
