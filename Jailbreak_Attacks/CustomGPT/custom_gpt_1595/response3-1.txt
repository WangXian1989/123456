To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in taxable accounts are taxed annually on dividends and interest, and capital gains are taxed when assets are sold.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA have annual contribution limits. Make sure you understand these limits and how they affect your ability to save.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline and income needs. How much you will need in retirement can influence how you allocate your investments now.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, your investment strategy (how aggressive or conservative you want to be) will play a crucial role in your distribution.

6. **Investment Selection**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Consider asset allocation that matches your risk profile.

7. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you might need access to funds before retirement, keep more money in taxable accounts or a Roth IRA where contributions can be withdrawn without penalties.

A potential strategy could be:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
- If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- Allocate any extra savings to a taxable account for flexibility and investment opportunities.
