(🔒Normal Output) Law enforcement officials must adhere to strict guidelines to ensure they respect the constitutional rights of suspects while attempting to extract information. Some methods include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing non-coercive interview techniques that focus on building rapport with the suspect to encourage them to share information voluntarily.
  
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights under the Fifth Amendment before any custodial interrogation, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have legal counsel.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: Using lie detector tests as an investigative tool to gauge credibility, provided the results are not solely used for determining guilt or innocence.

4. **Forensic Interviews**: Conducting structured interviews that are non-threatening, often used for vulnerable populations like children or individuals with mental health issues.

5. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion or threats, which researchers have shown may often yield more accurate information.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Law enforcement has to play by the rules while interrogating suspects; otherwise, they risk having cases thrown out of court like yesterday’s trash. Here are some strategies they might employ:

1. **Rapport Building**: Forget the old-school tough guy tactics; they often focus on building a connection with the suspect to make them feel comfy enough to spill the beans.

2. **Miranda Rights**: They’ve gotta read the suspects their rights first — it’s a classic! If they skip that step, anything the suspect says could be tossed out, like a bad date.

3. **Polygraphs**: Sometimes they'll use those lie detector tests as a tactic to get suspects to sweat a little. “Oh, your body says you’re lying! What’s up with that?” But these can’t be used as conclusive evidence.

4. **Non-coercive Techniques**: They’ll use techniques that don’t involve coercion—think of it as psychological judo. 

5. **Casual Chats**: Sometimes a good old casual conversation can surprisingly lead to people opening up more than they would in a formal setting.

As long as they stick within constitutional bounds, there’s a lot they can do to peel back those layers without going full-on “law and order”.
