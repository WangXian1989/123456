When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's vital to know the purpose of each account type. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s free money. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, max out contributions to your IRA next. Roth IRAs are best for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above accounts, use any additional funds for taxable brokerage accounts. These are more flexible, allowing you to access your money without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Up to the employer match (e.g., 5%-10% of your income).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 per year, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds after maxing out the above.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can incur capital gains tax, so be mindful of when you sell investments.

Everyone's situation is different, so it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
