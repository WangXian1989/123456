The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)** are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are advantageous if you expect your income to increase, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts** are suitable for funds that you may need before retirement or for investments that generate favorable capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to hold higher-risk investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to allow for growth without immediate tax consequences.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so itâ€™s wise to review your allocations periodically and adjust as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: To tailor a strategy specifically for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take into account all aspects of your financial life.

Ultimately, the right distribution plan will depend on your individual circumstances, so it's essential to assess your priorities and goals.
