(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. They offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts Next**: If you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how withdrawals from these accounts will be taxed in retirement. Taxable accounts may provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
